# Studio skills: index

The `studio` skill is the only one loaded always. It reads this file to route the rest.

Two lookups below. The **Trigger table** is exact-match against phrases in the user's message. The **Topic map** is a fallback when no phrase matches but the topic is Studio-shaped.

**Resolving a skill file: two layouts, try both, in this order:**

1. `../<name>/SKILL.md`, the **installed** layout (`~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`). Claude Code gives every skill its own directory. This is what a customer has.
2. `./<name>.md`, the **repo** layout (`skills/src/<name>.md`, `docs/prompts/<name>.md`).

Every name below is written `<name>` for readability. Apply this rule to each. Read them from disk. Never rely on remembered summaries. **If neither path resolves, say the pack looks mis-installed and name the skill. Never fall back silently to general knowledge**, because a silent fallback is indistinguishable from the pack working.

---

## Trigger table

If the user's message contains any phrase in the left column, Read the skill in the right column and follow it.

> **Mandatory atomic-and-reusable rule: applies to EVERY row below.** Never register or author a component that renders more than one piece of content. Decompose it first ([`decompose-jsx-to-atomics`](decompose-jsx-to-atomics.md)). Check for an existing atomic or Section before creating one. Header / footer / nav / menus are shared Sections with their menus as **Repeaters over a field**, never hardcoded lists. One atomic prop binds one CT field. See the `studio` router § Standing rule.
>
> **Mandatory plan-first rule: applies before every build row below.** If the request is to build/create/implement anything larger than one already-scoped piece ("build me a rewards page", "implement this design", "add this page to Studio", "build the site", "migrate this route"), Read [`plan-studio-architecture`](plan-studio-architecture.md) **first** and get the plan explicitly approved. Only then run the build skills it names. Skipping this is what produces a single monolithic template with no Sections, no Section Slots and no reuse, forcing the user to re-prompt. Straight to a build skill only when the user is iterating on a piece from an already-approved plan.

> **Mandatory auth preflight: applies before every row below.** Settle the credential before the first API call, OAuth-first per [`authenticate-cma`](authenticate-cma.md). Never ask for a session `authtoken`. If nothing resolves, hand the user `! CONTENTSTACK_REGION=<code> npx @contentstack/mcp --auth` (interactive, so it cannot be run for them). `403 error_code 316` means wrong org, not missing auth.

> **Mandatory done-rule: applies after every build row below.** Eight deliverables are mandatory on every build and all eight fail silently: `cslp.appendTags`, `studioAttributes` + `$`-twins per component, `thumbnailUrl` per registration, `ui_preview` per Section, stack Live Preview + preview token, the `/canvas` route, **publishing every Section and Template** (an edit creates an unpublished version. Delivery keeps serving the old one), and **a template actually composed of Sections**. A single component bound to the whole page body renders perfectly and fails no other check, so count `section-composition` nodes before reporting done. Read [`complete-the-build`](complete-the-build.md). It is the handover gate, and `plan-studio-architecture` commits to it up front. Never report a build finished with any row outstanding.

## Topic map

Grouped by intent. Use when the user's message is Studio-shaped but no trigger phrase matches. Pick the closest by name and Read the file.

### 1. Start here (pick these first, before any state change)

- **start-here-zero-knowledge**: zero-knowledge onboarding orchestrator.
- **studio-tour**: intent-driven walkthrough that routes to specialist skills.
- **analyze-project-fit**: read-only diagnostic of the user's project. Run before any install.
- **authenticate-cma**: how every API call is authenticated: the OAuth-first credential ladder (verified from the CLI's own resolver), scope headers, token refresh, and the 401/422 signature table. Read before writing any `curl`.
- **complete-the-build**: the eight always-mandatory deliverables (CSLP tags, `studioAttributes`, component + section thumbnails, Live Preview, `/canvas`, publishing, and a template actually composed of Sections) and the verification block that proves them. Run at the end of every build, and cite it in the plan at the start.
- **plan-studio-architecture**: analyse the starting point (existing code, part-built project, design, or prose), then print a plan for approval: Sections + linked schemas, Section Slots, registered **and** built-in components, CTs, Connected-vs-Freeform per page, build order. **Nothing is built until it's approved.** Run first for any non-trivial build request.
- **understand-installation**: what installing Studio actually adds to a project.

### 2. Install and configure

- **enable-visual-experience**: stack-level Live Preview + Visual Experience gate. Do this first.
- **install-studio**: install + wire studio-react + Live Preview + Delivery SDK.
- **install-live-preview**: Live Preview alone, without the full Studio SDK.
- **install-playwright-mcp**: optional MCP to automate the click-through verification skills.
- **install-contentstack-mcp**: optional MCP for CMA OAuth + tool-call provisioning (no pasted authtoken). Prod DCs only.
- **setup-local-https-canvas**: mkcert cert for the canvas app (mixed-content block on localhost).
- **configure-studio**: set Environment, Language, Canvas URL on the Studio project.
- **upgrade-studio-sdk**: bump the seven studio-* packages together, read CHANGELOGs, smoke-check.

### 3. Provisioning (Contentstack side)

- **provision-studio-project**: bootstrap the compositions CT + publish + delivery-token via API.
- **provision-studio-stack**: seed page CTs, global fields, entries, assets outside the compositions CT.
- **register-breakpoints**: register default/tablet/mobile at SDK boot.
- **import-content**: bulk-ingest entries into CTs from a customer-owned source (JSON / CSV / Markdown / existing Contentstack stack). Idempotent + resumable. Competitor-CMS migrations are out of scope. Use `@contentstack/cli-cm-import` for those. See [`agent-idempotency`](../../docs/50-advanced/agent-idempotency.md).
- **migrate-ct-schema**: evolve a live CT schema safely (add / rename / retype / remove fields. Extract to Global Field). Risk-classified, dry-run-first, dual-write for high-risk changes, rollback via before-snapshot.

### 4. Register your components

- **design-component-library**: meta-planning skill. Apply the atom + layout taxonomy from [`docs/00-getting-started/composable-primitives.md`](../../docs/00-getting-started/composable-primitives.md) to the user's design system BEFORE any registration is written. Emits a decomposition sheet with the 10-primitive proposal and DS token gaps flagged. Run first when a project is starting fresh with a component library or when the user asks "what should I register".
- **classify-existing-component**: diagnostic. Runs Q1 of the four-question framework on **one** component and stops: Atom, Layout, or Compound. Routes to the right next skill (`register-component` for atoms/layouts, `decompose-jsx-to-atomics` for JSX compounds, `decompose-design` for design-input compounds). Use when auditing an existing registry, sanity-checking before registration, or triaging "authors can't rearrange this" reports.
- **register-component**: read a React component, infer prop schema, emit a `registerComponent` call.
- **register-json-rte**: register the unified RTE renderer (`registerRTERenderer`) covering **JSON RTE, HTML RTE and Markdown** in one call, plus embedded entries/assets and custom element types. The skill name says json-rte for history. The API is not JSON-RTE-only.
- **byoc-end-to-end**: orchestrator for the whole BYOC arc (register, section, template, publish, in that order).
- **design-section-from-jsx**: from a JSX component, propose the section's linked-schema shape.
- **figma-generate-components**: turn Figma frames into React components + registry entries via the Studio Figma plugin.
- **import-design-tokens**: Tailwind / CSS vars / JSON tokens into Studio's Design Panel.

### 5. Wire preview routes

- **setup-section-preview**: mount `<StudioCanvas />` in the app + set Canvas URL on the project.
- **setup-template-preview-routes**: wildcard (catch-all) vs dedicated routes. Wildcard also wires site-chrome preservation + 404 handling.
- **configure-csr-vs-ssr**: choose CSR (`useCompositionData`) vs SSR (`sdk.fetchCompositionData`).

### 6. Author sections and templates

- **match-existing-pattern**: **MANDATORY before authoring a Template or Section in a project that already has compositions.** Inflates every composition's `ui`, derives how the project builds (repeater + condition + sections, section list, single component, atoms), and reports the patterns as layer trees. With one pattern, build that way. With several, the user picks from previews. Prevents the rework of authoring something structurally foreign to what is already there.

- **decompose-design**: take a design artefact (Figma / screenshot / PDF / description) and emit a full three-layer inventory: atomics + Layer-2 containers + layout components + Sections + Content Type shape. THE entry point for greenfield Studio builds starting from a design.
- **decompose-jsx-to-atomics**: break an existing React component (often a whole page in one file) into Layer-1 atomics, Layer-2 containers and Layer-3 Sections so its parts become reusable. Run before `discover-sections` on an existing codebase. The code-input twin of `decompose-design`.
- **decompose-design**: take one design (Figma / screenshot / mock) and emit a build sheet + three-layer inventory + proposed CT shape. **THE entry point for greenfield single-page builds starting from a design.** Drives the whole flow end-to-end: the build sheet, then an offer to scaffold code, then an offer to author via CMA API or Playwright MCP, then verification.
- **decompose-site**: multi-page orchestrator. Wraps `decompose-design` per template, deduplicates atomics + Layer-2 components across pages, identifies Global Field candidates, emits a consolidated site plan + per-template build sheets in dependency order. **Use for greenfield multi-page marketing sites**, and for a whole Figma board of section variants: § Step 1b collapses variant frames into `choice` props instead of one Section per frame.
- **discover-sections**: inventory a codebase for section candidates (components that recur across routes).
- **decompose-blocks-page**: execute the split when a page body is one modular-blocks field and one component renders every block type: the scope-filter prop, occurrence pinning when a type repeats, rebuilding the root slot from the pre-decomposition version so sibling nodes survive, and the field-name ceiling on Section reuse. The authoring half of `discover-sections-from-ct`.
- **resolve-reference-depth**: walk a reference chain one hop at a time by declaring each hop's path, then stop and ask the user for a path, an entry uid or a depth as soon as a path cannot be derived. Why `include_all_depth` measured inert, why `include[]` takes schema paths rather than payload paths, and telling an unresolved stub apart from genuinely empty content.
- **discover-sections-from-ct**: inventory an EXISTING Content Type for Section candidates. Walks the schema tree (root + Groups + References + Modular Blocks) and proposes one Section per scope with the correct linkedSchemaKind. The counterpart to `discover-sections` for teams starting with populated CMS content rather than existing route files.
- **compose-marketing-section**: given a design comp and already-registered primitives, pick the primitive tree that composes the section on the canvas. Points at the four canonical recipes (Hero, Feature Grid, Testimonial, Pricing) or drafts a new composition when the shape diverges.
- **build-section**: link a section to a structural schema (CT / GF / Group / Modular Block / Block / Reference).
- **build-repeating-section**: greenfield List Section: parent + child Section pattern iterating a multi-valued field.
- **adapt-collection-component**: compatibility adapter for wrapping a legacy production wrapper into a Studio List Section (wrapper-with-slot + Repeater + leaf adapter). Reach for this only when the native array-prop path (`build-repeating-section` § array-prop alternative) won't fit: Modular Block polymorphism, template-author child-swap, or non-reducible leaf shapes.
- **choose-connected-vs-freeform**: Connected default. Freeform is last resort. Emits the next skill.
- **build-connected-template**: content-type-bound template. Every entry renders at a derived URL.
- **build-page-builder-template**: the author-composes-the-page pattern: a Modular Block of section types, one Section per block, one template with a Repeater + a Condition Block per block. One template renders every layout.
- **build-freeform-template**: static template with Additional Entry Data pins and Pinned Queries.
- **pin-entry-to-freeform**: pin one entry to a freeform template as Additional Entry Data.
- **pin-query-to-freeform**: pin a CDA query so a Repeater source iterates dynamic content.
- **use-repeater**: Repeater bound to a multi-valued field on a section or template canvas.
- **use-condition-block**: inside a Repeater over modular blocks / references, condition per item shape.
- **use-section-slot**: carve a slot into an already-designed section for per-instance swaps.
- **configure-slot-defaults**: give a Section Slot a default section for its empty state, and an allowed-sections whitelist gating what drops in.
- **expose-section-props**: expose specific component props so template authors override per instance.
- **embed-composition**: embed ONE editable region in a code-owned page via `useCompositionData({ compositionUid })`.
- **author-without-code**: end-to-end authoring path for content teams on an already-installed project.
- **author-composition-via-api**: write composition JSON directly via the CMA (headless / seed / migration).
- **use-compositions-api**: create/read/list/update/delete compositions via the managed Studio API service (validated, `ui` compressed for you, your own credential forwarded: OAuth or session). The higher-level counterpart to `author-composition-via-api`.

### 7. Bind data

- **wire-component-default-data**: per-prop `defaultValue` so a component renders on drop before any binding.
- **wire-studio-state**: declared state variables authors can bind, a custom store via `getState`/`setState`/`subscribe`, and named functions wired to buttons through `action` props (BYOS).
- **wire-external-data**: non-Contentstack data via the `data` prop on `<StudioComponent />`.
- **understand-bring-your-own-data**: pick between the three render-time surfaces: the `data` prop, `<StudioComposition context>`, and `<Slot data>`.
- **render-with-own-data**: render a composition (page or standalone section) against a `context` object you already hold, via `<StudioComposition />` + spec-only `sdk.fetchComposition`.
- **wire-slot-data**: carry an owning component's data into whatever an author drops into its `slot` prop, bindable under Component Default Data.
- **wire-variant-alias**: Personalize variant alias from cookie/header into `<StudioComponent />`.

### 8. Migrate and ship

- **migrate-page-to-studio**: final swap of a route from hand-coded JSX to `<StudioComponent />`.
- **deploy-studio-site**: Vercel/Netlify env vars, composition Deploy, Live Preview gating, region config.

### 9. Verify and troubleshoot

- **verify-setup**: layered smoke test (Delivery / Live Preview / Visual Editor / Studio).
- **verify-visual-parity**: brownfield migration: drive a browser to compare composed vs production Section-by-Section, classify drift by cause class, fix at the source (adapter / registration / wrapper CSS).
- **troubleshoot**: symptom router. Classify the failure and hand off to the right specialist.
- **troubleshoot-canvas**: canvas won't load, blank iframe, SDK not initialized.
- **gate-third-party-scripts**: keep cookie banners / chat widgets / GTM / pixels out of the canvas via the SDK's editor-mode contract (`isStudioCanvas`).
- **troubleshoot-composition-resolution**: wrong URL renders, template pattern collisions, 404s.
- **troubleshoot-data-binding**: bound fields render nothing / wrong value / literal `{{`.
- **troubleshoot-ssr-rendering**: SSR/RSC failures, `use client` boundary, registry singleton.

### 10. Concepts (read when the user asks what is X, not how do I X)

- **understand-sections**: a section is a reusable page part.
- **understand-templates**: templates compose sections. One template renders N live pages.
- **understand-section-slots**: designated swap points inside a section.
- **understand-linked-schemas**: the section's declared data shape. Why auto-binding works.
- **understand-auto-binding**: the algorithm matching section schema to template CT.
- **understand-canvas-url**: why it's a relative path, not a full URL.
- **understand-canvas-vs-component**: `<StudioCanvas />` (Studio iframe) vs `<StudioComponent />` (visitor routes).
- **understand-authoring-headlessly**: the entry `ui` zlib tree + `data_sources` shape, seven binding types.
