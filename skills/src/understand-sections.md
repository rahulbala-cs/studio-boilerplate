## When to use

Explain what a Section is: a reusable page part (hero, feature grid, CTA banner) built by binding atomic React components to CMS data, optionally composing into compounds.

Use as the concept on-ramp before any Section-authoring skill, or when a new user asks "what is a Section". Phrases: "what's a Section", "Section vs Template", "reusable page parts". Do NOT use to actually create a Section. For that, run `build-section`. Concept only.

CONTENTSTACK_REGION=<code> npx @contentstack/mcp --auth` (it needs a TTY and a browser, so it cannot be run for them) and wait. `403 error_code 316` is a valid credential aimed at another org: fix the org or the `api_key`, do **not** re-authenticate.

# What is a Section?

## The one-line answer

**A Section is a reusable part of a webpage (a hero, a feature grid, a testimonial strip, a CTA banner, a footer) with its CMS data binding already baked in.** It's a compound React component: one or many of your atomic components, bound to specific CMS fields, packaged as one drop-in unit that authors can place on any template.

Think of the parts of a webpage you build over and over: every site has a hero, several content blocks, some CTAs, a footer. In a hand-coded site each is a JSX snippet you copy-paste between pages. In Studio those are **Sections**, authored once, bound to CMS data once, then reused everywhere by drag-and-drop.

## A Section in plain language

Imagine a marketing page. From top to bottom you might see:

1. A **hero** with a headline, subheading, background image, and a CTA button
2. A **feature grid** with three feature cards (icon + title + body each)
3. A **testimonial strip** with a quote, author, and avatar
4. A **CTA banner** with a headline and a button
5. A **footer** with links and a logo

Each of those five chunks is **a Section** in Studio. Each one is a part of the page, designed to be reused on similar pages with different content.

## A Section is a compound component

A **compound component** assembled from your atomic React components and bound to your CMS:

```
Section "Hero"  =  <Hero/>  +  binding to CT `hero_section`  +  entry "Homepage Hero"
Section "ProductHighlight"  =  <Hero/> + 3×<FeatureCard/> + <CTABlock/>
                              + bindings to product_highlight CT
                              + entry sources for each
```

Two anatomies, same kind of thing: a reusable, bindable, previewable unit. The atomic components inside don't change. Their composition + binding map is what the Section carries.

> **What you DON'T do:** build a separate React component just to be "a Section." Sections are not a new component type. They're a composition + binding wrapper around the atomic React components you already have.

## What a Section adds on top of a raw component

A registered atomic component (`<Hero/>` with props `headline`, `subhead`, `imageUrl`) becomes a Section when you add three things:

| Layer | What it carries |
|---|---|
| **Binding map** | Which CMS field drives which prop, in which iteration scope. E.g. `props.headline ← hero_section.title`, `props.subhead ← hero_section.subtitle`. |
| **Composition** | If the Section is compound (multiple atomic components), the layout/order/nesting and any Section Slots (substitution points). |
| **Live preview against real data** | The composed unit renders in Studio's canvas with the actual entry the binding points at, same data a visitor would see. Storybook shows a single component with mock props. A Section shows the composed shape with the real CMS content. |

The atomic React code never changes. The "extra knowledge" lives as data in Studio.

## What qualifies as a Section

**The operational rule: a Section qualifies when the binding work amortizes**: i.e., when the same N bindings would otherwise be repeated by the author every time the component is dropped on a template. Sections pay off by baking the binding map ONCE. Reuse is free thereafter.

Two amortizing shapes:

1. **The component has ≥2 separate prop bindings**: a Hero with `title` + `cover.url`, a Card with `image` + `title` + `summary` + `link`, a ProductHighlight composed of a Hero + 3 FeatureCards + a CTA. Without a Section, every template drop = N right-panel binding clicks. With a Section, those N bindings are saved once. The author drops the Section and every prop is already wired.
2. **The component takes one prop bound to a structural shape**: Modular Block list, Reference array, Group field, Global Field. The outer bind is 1 click, but the internal rendering walks N sub-fields per iteration (or per nested object). That sub-field binding work amortizes the same way.

The only case that does **NOT** qualify:

- **A single atomic component bound to a single primitive (scalar) field**: `Heading` bound to `entry.title`, `Image` bound to `entry.cover.url`, `Text` bound to `entry.tagline`. One bind, one drop, no repetition cost: wrapping it as a Section gives no payoff. Studio's picker also rejects scalar fields at the Connect-a-Schema step. Use these components inline as Basic field components on a Template or inside another Section.

**Diagnostic question:** "If I drop this component on the next template, how many bindings would the author wire by hand?"
- ≥2 bindings: make it a Section
- 1 binding: leave it as a registered component used inline

## When to make something a Section vs leave it as a registered component

| Leave it as a registered component (no Section) | Make it a Section |
|---|---|
| Single bound prop, single primitive value (`Heading` bound to `entry.title`), one click to bind, no amortization | ≥2 bound props (`Hero` bound to `entry.title` plus `entry.cover.url`), author would otherwise wire each prop on every drop |
| Component takes a single scalar | Component takes a structural-shape value (Group, Global Field, Modular Block, Block, Reference) whose internal rendering walks multiple sub-fields |
| Used as a primitive inside other compositions | Authors recognise it as "a part of a page" (hero, footer, CTA strip, card grid) and drop it themselves with bindings pre-wired |

If in doubt: ask "how many bindings will the author wire by hand on the next drop?" If ≥2, make it a Section.

## How Sections relate to Templates

- **Atoms** are your registered React components (Button, Card, Hero, FeatureCard, …).
- **Sections** combine atoms and their CMS binding, which produces a reusable part of a page.
- **Templates** combine Sections into a full page shape (e.g. a connected template for `blog_post` content type).

A template is essentially a stack of Sections. Authors drop Sections onto a template, and the template-plus-Sections renders a live page at the matching URL.

## When to expose a Section Slot

Any Global Field / Modular Block / Group / Reference field on the CT is a strong Slot candidate: default to exposing a Slot rather than inlining. See `understand-section-slots` § When to expose one: the Global Field / Modular Block / Group / Reference heuristic.

## Where you'll see Sections in Studio

- **Sections tab** in the Studio project: lists every Section authored in this project. The skill `discover-sections` lists them programmatically.
- **Sections category** in the palette when you're inside a Template canvas: drag from here onto the template.
- **As nested children** when you compose one Section inside another (a Section can include another Section via Section Slots, see `use-section-slot`).

## Where you'll see Sections in your codebase

- **You won't.** Sections live in Studio as data: they reference your registered components by `componentType` UID but they aren't React components in your repo. The atomic React components ARE in your repo (the ones you ran `register-component` on). The Sections that compose them are data Studio holds.

## What a Section is NOT

| Misconception | Reality |
|---|---|
| "A Section is a new React component I need to write" | No. Sections are composed from atomic components you already have. No new code per Section. |
| "A Section is the same thing as a Template" | No. A Section is a part of a page (reusable block). A Template is a whole page shape (a stack of Sections). |
| "A Section locks me into one piece of content" | No. The binding map references a CMS field (e.g. `hero_section.title`). Different entries that share the CT shape can drive the same Section on different page instances. |
| "Sections are only for marketing teams" | No. Sections are the unit of reusable page parts: engineering, design, and authors all benefit. Engineering builds the atoms once. Everyone composes Sections forever. |
