## When to use

Ship a Studio site to Vercel/Netlify: production env vars, composition Deploy, Live Preview gating, region/host config, cache and 401 gotchas.

Use when deploying a Studio site, setting up Vercel/Netlify, configuring production env vars, wiring Live Preview only on preview deploys, or debugging "deployed but visitors see old content / blank page / Live Preview chrome in production / 401 from Delivery API". Two layers ship independently: composition (Save+Deploy in canvas) and host (env vars + build + push).

> **Mandatory auth preflight: settle the credential before the first API call.** Resolve it OAuth-first per [`authenticate-cma`](authenticate-cma.md): `CS_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN`, else the Contentstack MCP's stored session. **Never ask the user for a session `authtoken`.** If nothing resolves, or a refresh fails with `400 invalid_refresh_token`, hand them `! CONTENTSTACK_REGION=<code> npx @contentstack/mcp --auth` (it needs a TTY and a browser, so it cannot be run for them) and wait. `403 error_code 316` is a valid credential aimed at another org: fix the org or the `api_key`, do **not** re-authenticate.

# Deploy a Studio site

## Context

A Studio site ships in two independent layers, and both must be correct for the visitor URL to render the latest composition cleanly.

- **Composition Deploy**: publishes the composition record through Contentstack's publishing workflow (from the canvas to the target environment). See `docs/30-composition/save-vs-deploy-a-composition.md`.
- **App host**: your React/Next app on Vercel/Netlify that renders `<StudioComponent />` and reads from the Delivery SDK (via `sdk.fetchCompositionData` on the server when using SSR composition-by-URL).

The Delivery Token, Preview Token, and Environment are configured per-deploy: production deploys must NOT carry a Preview Token (otherwise visitors see Live Preview overlays), and preview deploys SHOULD carry one (otherwise authors lose the live edit-and-see-it loop).

Goal state: visitor hits the production URL, gets the latest deployed composition rendered cleanly (no Studio chrome, no Live Preview overlays), and authors see real-time updates only in preview contexts. Match the success screenshot in `assets/screenshots/template-blog-post-full-stack.png`.

## Task

### A. Host the app

1. **Confirm the build output type.** CSR (Vite/CRA, which produces static output) or SSR (Next/Remix). Vercel and Netlify both handle either. SSR needs a Node runtime, static needs nothing extra.

2. **Set production env vars** in the host dashboard. Same names as `.env.local` per `docs/10-setup/app-prerequisites/install-the-delivery-sdk.md`. Pick the prefix matching the framework (`NEXT_PUBLIC_`, `VITE_`, `REACT_APP_`, `PUBLIC_`, or plain `process.env` for Remix):
   - `<PREFIX>_CONTENTSTACK_API_KEY`: stack API key (`blt…`)
   - `<PREFIX>_CONTENTSTACK_DELIVERY_TOKEN`: `cs…`, scoped to the **production environment + branch**
   - `<PREFIX>_CONTENTSTACK_ENVIRONMENT`: `<prodEnvironment>` (e.g. `production`)
   - `<PREFIX>_CONTENTSTACK_DEFAULT_LOCALE`: e.g. `en-us`
   - `<PREFIX>_CONTENTSTACK_PREVIEW_TOKEN`: **omit on the production deploy**, set only on preview deploys
   - SSR composition-by-URL ONLY (server-only, no `PUBLIC` prefix): `STUDIO_COMPOSITION_CT_UID`, `CONTENTSTACK_DELIVERY_TOKEN`, `CONTENTSTACK_ENVIRONMENT`, `CONTENTSTACK_BRANCH`. See `docs/10-setup/app-prerequisites/ssr-composition-query.md`.

3. **Per-environment scoping** in the host dashboard:
   - **Production** deploy: `environment=<prodEnvironment>`, no preview token, Live Preview `enable: false`.
   - **Preview** deploy (Vercel Preview / Netlify Deploy Preview): `environment=<previewEnvironment>`, preview token set, Live Preview `enable: true`.

4. **Gate Live Preview init** so it only runs when a preview token exists. Per `docs/10-setup/app-prerequisites/install-live-preview.md`:
   ```ts
   const previewToken = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTENTSTACK_PREVIEW_TOKEN;

   ContentstackLivePreview.init({
     ssr: false,
     enable: Boolean(previewToken),
     stackDetails: { apiKey, environment },
     editButton: { enable: Boolean(previewToken) },
   });
   ```
   `editButton.enable` must be conditional too, otherwise visitors see Studio edit chrome in production.

5. **Non-US regions.** Set the Live Preview `host` to the regional preview host (e.g. `eu-rest-preview.contentstack.com`) and the Delivery SDK `region` to match. Regional CDN hosts: `eu-cdn.contentstack.com`, `azure-na-cdn.contentstack.com`, `azure-eu-cdn.contentstack.com`, `gcp-na-cdn.contentstack.com`, `au-cdn.contentstack.com`. **Non-prod (`*.csnonprod.com`) has no `region` shortcut**: every host is `<env>-<service>.csnonprod.com` and must be set explicitly. The full table is [`install-studio`](install-studio.md) § Non-prod hosts. Establish which data centre you're on first via [`analyze-project-fit`](analyze-project-fit.md) § 2b: Determine the data center. See `docs/10-setup/troubleshoot-common-studio-issues.md`.

6. **Push to the host's main branch** (or `vercel --prod` / `netlify deploy --prod`). Confirm the build picks up env vars by grepping the deploy logs for the expected `<PREFIX>_*` injection. `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` (and equivalents) are inlined at build time: adding a var after the build does nothing until you redeploy.

### B. Deploy the composition

7. **Save** in the canvas. Save persists the draft. Deploy publishes whatever was last saved. See `docs/30-composition/save-vs-deploy-a-composition.md`.

8. **Preview** in the canvas with Live Preview, switching the Preview Entry across a few real entries (for linked templates) to confirm bindings resolve. Repeater iteration bindings use `repeater.<field>`. Verify each iteration renders the expected entry data.

9. **Click Deploy** in the canvas toolbar (right cluster, next to Save). The Deploy modal opens: pick the target environments, decide "Send with References" vs "Send without References", confirm. The modal title says "Deploy Template" even for Sections. That's a label quirk, not a bug.

10. **Publish connected entries to the same environment.** For linked templates, the template can deploy fine but the page renders blank if the connected entry isn't published to `<prodEnvironment>`. Publish each connected entry to the target environment.

11. **Wait for publishing workflow.** If the stack has approvals or scheduling configured, the deploy is queued, not immediate. Check the Contentstack publish queue.

## Inputs needed from the user

In this order. Stop and ask if any required value is missing.

1. `host`: `vercel` or `netlify`
2. `framework`: needed to pick the env-var prefix
3. `prodEnvironment`: Contentstack environment name for the production deploy
4. `previewEnvironment`: Contentstack environment name for preview deploys (optional, skip if not using preview deploys)
5. `region`: defaults to `us`
6. `ssrCompositionByUrl`: yes/no, controls whether server-only env vars are required

If the user doesn't know an environment name, send them to `app.contentstack.com`, where they open the stack, go to Settings, and open Environments.

## Acceptance

This skill succeeds only when ALL of the following are true. If any fails, do not claim success. Surface the failure and stop.

- [ ] Production deploy has `<PREFIX>_CONTENTSTACK_ENVIRONMENT` set to `<prodEnvironment>` and **no** preview token set
- [ ] Preview deploy (if configured) has `<PREFIX>_CONTENTSTACK_PREVIEW_TOKEN` set and `environment=<previewEnvironment>`
- [ ] Live Preview `enable` and `editButton.enable` are gated on the preview token being present
- [ ] If SSR composition-by-URL: server-only `STUDIO_COMPOSITION_CT_UID`, `CONTENTSTACK_DELIVERY_TOKEN`, `CONTENTSTACK_ENVIRONMENT`, `CONTENTSTACK_BRANCH` are set
- [ ] Region/host pair matches the stack's region (non-US only)
- [ ] Composition is Saved and Deployed to `<prodEnvironment>` via the canvas Deploy modal
- [ ] All connected entries for linked templates are published to `<prodEnvironment>`
- [ ] Visitor URL opened in an incognito session renders the composition with no Studio chrome, no Live Preview edit buttons
- [ ] In DevTools, the Network tab shows Delivery API calls hitting `cdn.contentstack.io` (or the regional CDN), not the preview host
- [ ] Preview deploy (if configured) updates live on entry edit without reload

## Common pitfalls

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deployed but visitors see old content | CDN / ISR / SSG cache | Lower TTL or trigger revalidation. For Next set `revalidate` or use on-demand revalidation |
| Page renders blank post-deploy | Connected entry not published to target env | Publish the entry to `<prodEnvironment>` |
| Visitors see Live Preview edit buttons / overlays | `enable: true` unconditional in prod build | Gate `enable` and `editButton.enable` on the preview token |
| Preview deploy doesn't update live | `onEntryChange` not wired to refetch, or preview token mismatch | See `docs/10-setup/verify-end-to-end.md`. Verify token matches the one in Contentstack |
| `region` / `host` mismatch error | Non-US stack with US defaults | Set Delivery SDK `region` and Live Preview `host` to the region |
| Deploy "succeeded" but composition didn't change | Pending approval / scheduled publish | Check Contentstack publish queue |
| Build fails on host with missing env var | `<PREFIX>_*` only inlined at build time | Set vars in the host dashboard before triggering the build. Redeploy after adding |
| Delivery token returns 401 in production | Token scoped to wrong environment or branch | Generate a token scoped to the prod environment + branch. Rotate in host env vars |
| SSR composition-by-URL 500s | Missing server-only `STUDIO_COMPOSITION_CT_UID` / `CONTENTSTACK_BRANCH` | Add server-only vars per `docs/10-setup/app-prerequisites/ssr-composition-query.md` |
