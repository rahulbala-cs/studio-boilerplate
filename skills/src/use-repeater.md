## When to use

Drop a Repeater on a section or template canvas and bind it to a multi-valued field so the same shape renders once per item. Two-mode mental model: bind-then-iterate.

Use when rendering the same component once per item from a multi-valued source: Modular Block lists, multi-Reference fields, Group with multiple:true, or any array field. Phrases: "repeat per item", "list of blocks", "iterate references". Pair with `use-condition-block` for heterogeneous iteration items (Modular Blocks, References). Do NOT use for single-value fields.

CONTENTSTACK_REGION=<code> npx @contentstack/mcp --auth` (it needs a TTY and a browser, so it cannot be run for them) and wait. `403 error_code 316` is a valid credential aimed at another org: fix the org or the `api_key`, do **not** re-authenticate.

# Use a Repeater

## Context

> **Prerequisite: the canvas must render.** This is a canvas operation. If the section/template canvas is blank, the canvas chain isn't wired (route + Canvas URL path + the targeted environment's per-locale Base URL). Run [`setup-section-preview`](setup-section-preview.md) first. It walks the whole chain, including the env Base URL.

A Repeater is a Smart Container that renders its child subtree once per item of a multi-valued source: Modular Block lists, Reference fields with multiple entries, Group with `multiple: true`, or any array field.

**The scope rule, in user terms:** clicking inside a Repeater switches the Data Picker roots. Outside the Repeater = the Section's linked-schema fields. **Inside the Repeater = the iteration item's fields, labelled "Repeater Data".** Bind from whichever root the picker shows. The location determines the shape, not your choice.

When the iteration items are heterogeneous (Modular Block lists, or References [single-CT and multi-CT]), the immediate child of the Repeater must be a Condition Block. Studio surfaces an inline hint when you bind a child directly and offers to wrap it for you.

## What goes into a repeating Slot: a Section, not a raw component

When the Repeater contains a Section Slot (the common "list of cards" pattern), what fills the slot is **another Section**, not a raw registered component: the Section's pre-bound linked schema auto-binds to each iterated item, so no per-prop hand-binding is needed. See `understand-section-slots` § What fills a Slot: a Section, not a raw component.

Reference: `docs/34-smart-containers/create-repeatable-content-with-repeaters.md`.

## Task

1. **Confirm the source field is multi-valued.** Inspect `sourceFieldPath` on the connected content type or Pinned Query. If it is single-valued (single reference, group with `multiple: false`, scalar), stop. Redirect the user to bind the component directly without a Repeater.

2. **Drag the Repeater tile from the palette.** In the palette, open **Smart Containers**, then drag **Repeater** onto the canvas region of `compositionName` where iterations should appear.

3. **Select the Repeater node from the Layers panel.** Clicking the Repeater on the canvas is unreliable because nested children intercept the click. Always select it from **Layers**.

4. **Bind the Repeater to the source.** In the right panel **Properties** section, click **Bind items** to open the Data Picker. Navigate to `sourceFieldPath`:
   - For a template field: pick under the connected content type root.
   - For a Pinned Query: pick under **Pinned Queries**.
   - The picked node must be a list/array. The picker disables scalar leaves for this slot.

5. **Wrap iteration in a Condition Block when required.** If `itemKind` is `modular-block` or `reference` (single-CT or multi-CT), the immediate child of the Repeater must be a Condition Block. The cleanest path: drop the `iterationComponent` directly inside the Repeater first. When you bind any prop on it, Studio shows an inline hint that this source needs a Condition Block. Accept the wrap prompt and Studio inserts the Condition Block around the component, scoping it to the active item type. For `group` and `array` of scalars, skip this step.

6. **Drop the iteration content inside the Repeater.**
   - **Preferred: drop a Section.** If the iteration content is non-trivial (a card with title + image + price + rating, etc.), build it as its own Section bound to the iterated item's CT and drop that Section into the Repeater (or into the Condition Block if step 5 applied, or into a Section Slot inside the Repeater. See the "What goes into a repeating Slot" pattern in Context above). The Section is pre-bound, nothing to wire per drop.
   - **Fallback: drop raw components.** For trivial single-prop iterations only, you can drop a raw registered component directly inside the Repeater and bind its props via the Data Picker. The picker is already showing the **Repeater Data** root (iteration item fields) because you're inside the Repeater. Pick from there, not from the parent Section's linked-schema fields. This works but doesn't scale beyond simple cases. Reach for the Section route the moment you have more than one or two props.

7. **Toggle Preview Mode on the Repeater to verify with real data.**

   Studio's canvas has two render modes for Smart Containers (Repeater, Condition Block, and similar):

   - **Design Mode (default).** Renders with **placeholder defaults**: Repeaters iterate once, Conditions show the un-checked branch, bindings on registered components resolve to their `defaultValue` from registration (not to real CMS data). Purpose: lay out structure without depending on live data. You can position, size, style, and arrange Sections without waiting for fetches or worrying about empty arrays.
   - **Preview Mode (toggle).** Renders with **real data**: Repeaters iterate over real items, Conditions apply real checks, bindings resolve to actual CMS values. Purpose: verify the bound result looks right against live content.

   You **design** in Design Mode and **verify** in Preview Mode. Both modes are correct for their phase of authoring. Don't treat Design Mode's single-iteration placeholder as a bug. It's by design, so you can edit the iteration shape without fetching N items every time you nudge a margin.

   Select the Repeater in Layers, open the right-panel **Configuration**, then toggle **Preview Mode** to confirm N iterations render with the expected per-item values.

8. **Save the composition.** Verify in Layers that the tree is `Repeater → (Condition Block →) iterationComponent`, and on the canvas (with Preview Mode on) that each iteration renders the expected per-item values.

## Inputs needed from the user

Collect these in order. Stop and ask if any is missing. Do not guess `sourceFieldPath` or `itemKind`.

1. `compositionName`: section or template hosting the Repeater
2. `sourceFieldPath`: a list field on the Section's linked schema, or a Pinned Query name
3. `itemKind`: one of `modular-block`, `reference`, `group`, `array` (drives whether a Condition Block is required)
4. `iterationComponent`: optional. If blank, prompt the user to drop one manually after step 5

## Acceptance

Succeeds only when ALL are true. If any fails, surface it and stop.

- [ ] A Repeater node exists in `compositionName`'s tree, selected and visible in Layers.
- [ ] The Repeater's **Bind items** property points at `sourceFieldPath` via the Data Picker.
- [ ] If `itemKind` is `modular-block` or `reference`: a Condition Block is the immediate (or sole) child of the Repeater, wrapping the iteration component.
- [ ] If a raw iteration component was dropped: its bound props all resolve under the **Repeater Data** root in the Data Picker (iteration-item fields), not the parent Section's linked-schema root. Confirm by inspecting any bound prop in the picker breadcrumb.
- [ ] If a child Section was dropped (preferred path): the Section appears inside the Repeater (or its Condition Block / Slot), with no hand-binding needed. The Section's own bindings flow through automatically.
- [ ] Preview Mode on the Repeater renders more than one iteration on the canvas, each showing distinct per-item values.
- [ ] The composition is saved.

## Common pitfalls

| Pitfall | Why it bites | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Selecting the Repeater by clicking the canvas | Nested children intercept the click. You end up selecting the wrong node and binding the wrong slot | Always select the Repeater from the **Layers** panel |
| Binding iteration props from the parent Section's linked-schema root instead of the iteration item's root | Resolves at parent scope: every iteration shows the same value | Inside the Repeater, the Data Picker shows the **Repeater Data** root automatically. Bind from there: those are the iteration item's fields. |
| Dropping a raw multi-prop card into a repeating Slot and hand-binding each prop | Doesn't scale beyond one or two props. Easy to miss a prop or pick the wrong path | Build the card as its own Section bound to the iterated item's CT, then drop that Section into the Slot. Section-level auto-binding handles the wiring. |
| Skipping the Condition Block for References | References (single-CT and multi-CT) are heterogeneous per Studio schema. Bindings silently fail to resolve | Accept Studio's inline wrap prompt, or insert a Condition Block manually as the Repeater's direct child |
| Expecting all iterations to render in Design Mode (Preview Mode off) | Design Mode renders one placeholder iteration on purpose so you can lay out the structure without depending on live data. It's not a bug. It's the design phase. | Toggle **Preview Mode** in Properties, under Configuration, when you're ready to verify with real data |
| Repeater still renders 0 items AFTER toggling Preview Mode on | Preview Mode controls whether bindings resolve, not whether they resolve correctly. If Preview Mode is on and the Repeater is still empty, the toggle isn't the issue. The binding shape is. Flipping Preview Mode again does nothing once it's already on. | Stop flipping the toggle. Diagnose the binding: re-check the Bind items source field, confirm the source has items in real data (in DevTools, open the Network tab and read the composition or entry payload), verify scope (is the binding picked from the right Data Picker root?), confirm the Condition Block is in place for Reference / Modular Block iteration. See `troubleshoot-data-binding` and `build-repeating-section`. |
| Dropping the Repeater on a single-value field | Repeater requires an iterable source. Binding rejects scalars | Bind the component directly without a Repeater |
| Dropping multiple iteration components as siblings inside the Repeater | All siblings render once per item, multiplying output unintentionally | Wrap intended iteration shape in a single container (Box/Row) inside the Repeater |
| Reaching for a Repeater on a static, single-instance page | Repeater exists to iterate a list. A page with one hero + one promo card has nothing to iterate: adding a Repeater introduces a phantom iteration scope, shifts the Data Picker to "Repeater Data" so the parent's fields aren't reachable, and leaves an empty iteration placeholder in the canvas | Confirm the data source is genuinely multi-valued BEFORE dropping a Repeater. For static single-instance content, drop the component directly on the canvas, no Repeater |
