## When to use

Seed a stack with page CTs, global fields, entries, and assets, the prerequisites a Studio project needs OUTSIDE the compositions CT. Covers asset upload + dedupe + publish.

Use when standing up a brand-new stack headlessly that a Studio project will consume (templates connect to these CTs, entries provide preview data, assets back image / file fields). Signals: "seed the stack", "create CTs + entries via API", "upload assets". Do NOT use for the compositions CT (`provision-studio-project`) or composition entries (`author-composition-via-api`).

> **Mandatory auth preflight: settle the credential before the first API call.** Resolve it OAuth-first per [`authenticate-cma`](authenticate-cma.md): `CS_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN`, else the Contentstack MCP's stored session. **Never ask the user for a session `authtoken`.** If nothing resolves, or a refresh fails with `400 invalid_refresh_token`, hand them `! CONTENTSTACK_REGION=<code> npx @contentstack/mcp --auth` (it needs a TTY and a browser, so it cannot be run for them), and wait. `403 error_code 316` is a valid credential aimed at another org: fix the org or the `api_key`, do **not** re-authenticate.

# Provision Studio Stack (CTs, entries, assets)

## Context

A Studio project references content that lives in the stack: page CTs (e.g. `blog_post`, `product`), global fields they reuse, entries that satisfy URL patterns, and assets bound to file fields. [`provision-studio-project`](provision-studio-project.md) handles the stack-wide setup (Live Preview, environment, delivery + preview tokens) and creates the compositions CT. This skill handles everything else: the **content types the compositions connect to**, the **entries** that preview them, and the **assets** that fill their file fields.

All operations are CMA-only (`api.contentstack.io` and regional variants). Auth = `api_key` + `$CS_AUTH`, resolved OAuth-first: **assume no session `authtoken` exists**. See [`authenticate-cma`](authenticate-cma.md). **Non-prod (`*.csnonprod.com`) has no `region` shortcut**: every host is `<env>-<service>.csnonprod.com` and must be set explicitly. The full table is [`install-studio`](install-studio.md) § Non-prod hosts. Establish which data centre you're on first via [`analyze-project-fit`](analyze-project-fit.md) § 2b: Determine the data center.

> **MCP-authed path (optional).** If `CONTENTSTACK_MCP_READY` (from [`install-contentstack-mcp`](install-contentstack-mcp.md)), **most** CMA steps run as MCP tool calls, no pasted `authtoken`: global fields use `create_a_global_field` / `update_a_global_field`, page CTs use `create_a_content_type` / `update_content_type`, asset **dedupe** uses `get_all_assets`, asset **publish** uses `publish_an_asset`, entries use `create_an_entry` / `update_an_entry` (idempotent PUT branch) / `publish_an_entry`. **Two steps stay raw HTTP even with the MCP:** (1) the asset **binary upload** (Step 4, `POST /v3/assets` multipart, there is NO create/upload-asset MCP tool, only get/publish/update/delete), (2) the Step 7 **CDA verify** (a delivery-host read, `get_single_entry` is a CMA read and can't confirm publish state or file-field asset-URL resolution. `cda` isn't in the default `GROUPS` either). Supply the stack `api_key` upfront (the MCP can't discover it). Without that flag, use raw curl throughout.

## Task

1. **Prerequisites.** Stack exists with delivery + preview tokens. The compositions CT has been created via [`provision-studio-project`](provision-studio-project.md). You have `CS_AUTH_TOKEN`, `CS_API_KEY`, the target environment name, and the region's CMA host.

2. **Create / update global fields first.** Page CTs that reference global fields (e.g. `gf_hero`, `gf_card_list`) must have those GFs in place at CT create time. Contentstack rejects CT POSTs that reference an unknown global field uid.

   ```
   POST /v3/global_fields    (idempotent — check first via GET /v3/global_fields/<uid>)
   { "global_field": { "title": "...", "uid": "<uid>", "schema": [ ... ] } }
   ```

   Use `PUT /v3/global_fields/<uid>` to update an existing one. Same auth headers.

3. **Create page content types.** For each page CT (`blog_post`, `product`, `case_study`, etc.):

   ```
   POST /v3/content_types
   { "content_type": {
       "title": "Blog Post",
       "uid":   "blog_post",
       "schema": [ /* field definitions */ ],
       "options": {
         "is_page": true,                     // makes it a page CT (URL-aware)
         "url_pattern": "/blog/:title",       // optional — drives content_type_url_pattern URL source
         "singleton": false
       }
   } }
   ```

   Idempotency: check `GET /v3/content_types/<uid>` first. PUT on exists, POST otherwise.

   **Every CT MUST include a `source_uid` field for downstream chain compatibility.** This is a contract: [`import-content`](import-content.md) uses `source_uid` as its idempotency key when re-running imports. Skip it and the import silently creates duplicates on every re-run.

   ```json
   {
     "display_name": "Source UID",
     "uid":          "source_uid",
     "data_type":    "text",
     "field_metadata": { "description": "Idempotency key for imports from external sources", "default_value": "", "multiline": false, "version": 3 },
     "mandatory":    false,
     "unique":       false,
     "multiple":     false,
     "indexed":      true
   }
   ```

   **Important:** field UIDs MUST NOT start with an underscore. Contentstack rejects CT creation with error 115 (`The UID must begin with a letter, and can contain only lowercase letters, numbers, or underscores.`). Use `source_uid`, NOT `_source_uid`.

   **Page CT vs non-page CT.** Set `options.is_page: true` ONLY if entries of this CT should be addressable by URL (Connected Templates resolve against these). Non-page CTs (e.g. `author`, `testimonial`) are referenced from page entries but don't get their own URL.

4. **Upload assets.** Each file referenced by an entry must exist as a stack asset first. Use multipart upload to `POST /v3/assets`:

   ```
   POST /v3/assets    (multipart/form-data)
   Fields:
     asset[upload]    = <file stream>           (required)
     asset[title]     = <human-readable name>
     asset[parent_uid] = <folder uid>           (optional — omit for stack root)
     asset[tags]      = <comma-separated tags>  (optional)
   ```

   Response: `data.asset.{uid, url, content_type, file_size, ...}`.

   **Dedupe before upload.** A naive seed re-uploads the same image on every run, leaving orphans. Before posting, list existing assets and match by title (or by SHA-256 of bytes for true dedupe):

   ```
   GET /v3/assets?query={"title":"<name>","parent_uid":"<folder>"}&limit=1
   ```

   If a match exists, reuse `data.assets[0].uid`. Cache the mapping locally (e.g. `.asset-map.json` keyed by source filename, with the asset uid as the value) so cross-runs are idempotent.

   **Publish each asset** to the target environment before publishing entries that reference it. Unpublished assets surface as broken images in canvas and on the live site:

   ```
   POST /v3/assets/<uid>/publish
   { "asset": { "locales": ["en-us"], "environments": ["<env name>"] } }
   ```

5. **Create entries.** For each entry payload:

   - **Resolve asset references** before POSTing. File-field shape on CMA entries:
     - Single-file field: `"featured_image": "<asset_uid>"` (string)
     - Multiple-file field: `"images": ["<uid1>", "<uid2>"]` (array of strings)

     The CDA later resolves these to full asset objects (`{ uid, url, filename, ... }`), but on the WRITE side (CMA), pass uids.

   - **Resolve cross-entry references** by uid. Reference fields hold arrays of `{ uid: "<entry_uid>", _content_type_uid: "<ref_ct>" }` objects (a common pattern is a seed-uid map persisted at `.entry-map.json` to translate stable identifiers to server-assigned uids).

   - **JSON-RTE embeds** carry `attrs.locale` on every embedded entry / asset node. Omitting `attrs.locale` makes the embed render blank. Studio's RTE renderer matches embed locale to the page locale (P6).

   - **Idempotency.** Find by title (or another stable field) via `GET /v3/content_types/<ct>/entries?query={"title":"..."}&limit=1`. PUT on exists, POST otherwise.

   ```
   POST /v3/content_types/<ct>/entries
   { "entry": { "title": "...", /* all schema fields */ } }
   ```

6. **Publish each entry** to the target environment. Unpublished entries return 404 from the CDA. Connected Template canvas shows blank. Connected Template URL resolution also relies on the published entry existing for the connected CT (see [`build-connected-template`](build-connected-template.md) step 1).

   ```
   POST /v3/content_types/<ct>/entries/<entry_uid>/publish
   { "entry": { "locales": ["en-us"], "environments": ["<env>"] } }
   ```

7. **Verify.** For each seeded entry: `GET https://<cdn-host>/v3/content_types/<ct>/entries/<uid>?environment=<env>` returns 200 with all file-field references resolved to asset URLs.

## Acceptance

- [ ] All required global fields exist (`GET /v3/global_fields/<uid>` returns 200).
- [ ] All required page CTs exist with the expected schema, `options.is_page` set correctly per CT.
- [ ] Every CT includes a `source_uid` (text, non-mandatory, indexed) field so downstream `import-content` runs are idempotent. Field UID must NOT begin with `_`.
- [ ] Asset dedupe map (`.asset-map.json` or equivalent) persists across runs: re-running provision does NOT upload duplicates.
- [ ] Each asset is published to the target environment. **Always request with `?include_publish_details=true`** (`GET /v3/assets/<uid>?include_publish_details=true`) and require an explicit array entry for the env. The CMA omits `publish_details` unless asked (verified for entries, where the Studio SDK itself opts in with `include_publish_details: true`), and an omitted field is indistinguishable from an unpublished asset. Passing the flag is harmless if an endpoint returns the field anyway. **Absent ≠ unpublished, only `[]` is**.
- [ ] Each entry's file fields hold asset uid(s), not URLs or filenames.
- [ ] Each entry's reference fields hold `{ uid, _content_type_uid }` objects, with uids resolved from the seed-uid map.
- [ ] Each entry is published. CDA `GET /v3/content_types/<ct>/entries/<uid>?environment=<env>` returns 200.
- [ ] JSON-RTE embeds carry `attrs.locale` matching the entry's locale.

## Common pitfalls

| Pitfall | Why it bites | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Creating a CT that references a GF before the GF exists | CMA rejects POST `/v3/content_types` with "global field not found" | Create / update all global fields BEFORE page CTs |
| Re-uploading the same asset every provision run | Stack accumulates duplicate assets. Entry references go stale on re-create | Dedupe via `GET /v3/assets?query={"title":"…"}` + persist `.asset-map.json` |
| File-field value set to the asset URL or filename instead of uid | CMA accepts the POST but the field reads as broken in CDA | Pass `<asset_uid>` (string) for single-file, `[<uid>, ...]` for multi-file |
| Forgetting `_content_type_uid` on reference field entries | CDA can't resolve the reference. Field reads as empty | Each reference entry is `{ uid, _content_type_uid }` |
| JSON-RTE embed missing `attrs.locale` | Embed renders as a placeholder / blank | Set `attrs.locale` on every embedded entry / asset node (matches entry locale) |
| Asset published, entry referencing it NOT published | Entry 404s on CDA. Canvas blank | Publish entries AFTER assets, BEFORE testing canvas |
| Entry published, asset NOT published | Image fields surface broken URLs on the live site | Publish assets first |
| `options.is_page: true` set on a non-URL CT (e.g. `author`) | Studio surfaces the CT in URL-resolution probes. Spurious template matches | Set `is_page` only on URL-addressable CTs |
| Seed-uid map (`.entry-map.json`) deleted between runs | Cross-entry references break on subsequent runs (seed-uids no longer translate to server-uids) | Commit the map OR rebuild it from `GET /entries?query={"title":"..."}` lookups |
| Wrong region CMA host | 401 / 404 on every call | Use region-specific host (`eu-api.contentstack.com`, `azure-na-api.contentstack.com`, etc.) |
