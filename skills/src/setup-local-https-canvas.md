## When to use

Set up a locally-trusted HTTPS cert (via mkcert) for the canvas-app. NOT required for most local-dev: browsers treat `localhost` as trusted and allow Studio to iframe `http://localhost:<port>`.

Use ONLY when HTTPS-on-localhost is actually required: service workers, secure cookies, web-share/WebAuthn, strict corporate policies that block mixed content even for localhost, or production-parity smoke tests. Phrases: "I need https locally", "mixed-content block on localhost". Do NOT use for production (real HTTPS) or tunnels (Cloudflare/ngrok already ship certs).

> **Auth preflight: settle the credential before the first API call.** Resolve it OAuth-first per [`authenticate-cma`](authenticate-cma.md): `CS_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN`, else the Contentstack MCP's stored session. **Never ask the user for a session `authtoken`.** If nothing resolves, or a refresh fails with `400 invalid_refresh_token`, hand them `! CONTENTSTACK_REGION=<code> npx @contentstack/mcp --auth` (it needs a TTY and a browser, so it cannot be run for them) and wait. `403 error_code 316` is a valid credential aimed at another org: fix the org or the `api_key`, do **not** re-authenticate.

# Set up locally-trusted HTTPS for the canvas-app

## Context: when this is actually needed

Studio is served from `https://app.contentstack.com/#!/studio`. To preview your canvas-app, Studio loads it inside an iframe.

**For plain `http://localhost:<port>` the iframe just works** in modern browsers: Chrome, Firefox, and Safari all treat `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` as "potentially trustworthy" origins per the [W3C Secure Contexts spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/secure-contexts/), so mixed-content blocking does NOT apply. **You do not need mkcert for a basic Studio canvas iframe.**

HTTPS-on-localhost via mkcert is only needed when something else in your app requires HTTPS even at dev time:

- **Service workers**: require secure context. An HTTP localhost dev server can't register one
- **Secure cookies / SameSite=None+Secure**: set only over HTTPS, even on localhost
- **WebAuthn / WebShare / Payment Request**: gated on secure context
- **Strict corporate browser policy**: some MDM policies override the localhost exemption
- **Production-parity local testing**: to catch HTTPS-only bugs before deploy
- **Tunnel URLs (cloudflared / ngrok / lt)**: NOT localhost, so the secure-context exemption doesn't apply. The tunnel already gives you a trusted HTTPS URL, so mkcert wouldn't help anyway

If none of the above apply, **skip this skill** and use plain `http://localhost:<port>` as your Canvas URL origin / env base URL. Add mkcert later if a real need emerges.

## Task

### 1. Install mkcert (one-time per machine)

Detect the OS and use the right command:

```bash
# macOS
brew install mkcert nss
# nss is needed if you use Firefox; harmless otherwise

# Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt install libnss3-tools
# Then grab mkcert: https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/releases (or via Homebrew on Linux)

# Windows (PowerShell, as admin)
choco install mkcert
# or: scoop install mkcert
```

Verify:

```bash
mkcert -version
```

### 2. Install the local CA into the system trust store

```bash
mkcert -install
```

This adds mkcert's root CA to:
- macOS: Keychain (System trust)
- Linux: NSS-using browsers (Chromium, Firefox). Also writes to `/etc/ssl/certs` if `update-ca-certificates` is available
- Windows: Windows Certificate Store

You may be prompted for sudo / admin once. After this, every cert mkcert generates is automatically trusted by every browser on this machine (including the Playwright-MCP-driven one, if you're using that).

### 3. Generate the cert for the canvas-app

Inside `{{projectRoot}}`:

```bash
mkdir -p certs
mkcert -cert-file certs/localhost.pem -key-file certs/localhost-key.pem localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1
```

This emits a cert valid for `localhost`, IPv4 loopback, and IPv6 loopback. The cert is locally-trusted (signed by the mkcert root CA you installed in step 2).

### 4. Wire the cert into your framework's dev server

**Vite** (`vite.config.ts` / `.js`):

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';
import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  server: {
    https: {
      key:  readFileSync('certs/localhost-key.pem'),
      cert: readFileSync('certs/localhost.pem'),
    },
    port: {{devPort}},
    // Studio iframes from app.contentstack.com — allow it
    allowedHosts: true,
    headers: {
      'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
      'Content-Security-Policy': "frame-ancestors *;",
    },
  },
  preview: {
    https: {
      key:  readFileSync('certs/localhost-key.pem'),
      cert: readFileSync('certs/localhost.pem'),
    },
    port: {{devPort}},
    allowedHosts: true,
    headers: {
      'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
      'Content-Security-Policy': "frame-ancestors *;",
    },
  },
});
```

> The `allowedHosts: true` + CSP `frame-ancestors *` headers are required for Studio to iframe the app. Without them Vite returns "host not allowed" and the browser blocks the frame. They're part of this same setup. Don't split them into a separate step.

**Next.js**: pass your mkcert files to `next dev` via the `--experimental-https-key` + `--experimental-https-cert` flags:

```bash
next dev \
  --experimental-https \
  --experimental-https-key ./certs/localhost-key.pem \
  --experimental-https-cert ./certs/localhost.pem
```

Bare `next dev --experimental-https` generates its OWN self-signed cert (not signed by mkcert's root CA). Studio's iframe silently blocks it. Passing the key/cert flags points Next at the trusted mkcert pair. Fallback if the flags aren't available on your Next version: a custom `server.js` booting Node's https module with the mkcert files, or a prod build (`next build && next start`) behind a reverse proxy that terminates HTTPS with the mkcert cert.

**Remix / Astro**: follow the same pattern as Vite (both expose `server.https` config).

### 5. Update `.gitignore`

The private key is sensitive, never commit it:

```
# .gitignore
certs/
```

Confirm with:

```bash
git check-ignore -v certs/localhost-key.pem
```

### 6. Verify

```bash
# Start the dev (or preview) server
npm run dev   # or pnpm dev / yarn dev / bun dev

# In another terminal — confirm HTTPS works
curl -I https://localhost:{{devPort}}/
# Expect: HTTP/2 200 (or similar). No `(self signed certificate)` warning.

# Open in a normal browser tab — expect green lock, no cert warning.
```

Then test the Studio iframe:
1. Wherever Studio asks for your canvas-app's origin (the env-level setting that holds the canvas-app's host:port, set per Contentstack environment), make sure it's now `https://localhost:{{devPort}}`. The Studio Project's Canvas URL field stays `/canvas`. Canvas URL is a separate setting and it's just a path, never an origin.
2. Open any composition. The canvas iframe should load cleanly (no blank frame, no console error).

## Inputs needed from the user

1. `projectRoot`: the canvas-app directory.
2. `devPort`: the port your dev/preview server listens on. Vite default is 5173. Next is 3000.

## Acceptance

- [ ] `mkcert -version` returns a version string.
- [ ] `mkcert -install` completed (root CA in system trust store).
- [ ] `certs/localhost.pem` + `certs/localhost-key.pem` exist in the project root.
- [ ] Framework config has `server.https` + `preview.https` pointing at the cert pair, AND `allowedHosts: true` + `frame-ancestors *` header set.
- [ ] `.gitignore` contains `certs/`.
- [ ] `curl -I https://localhost:<port>/` returns a 200 with no untrusted-cert warning.
- [ ] Browser loads `https://localhost:<port>` with a green lock.
- [ ] Studio canvas (with the matching Canvas URL configured) shows the app inside its iframe, not a blank frame.

## Common pitfalls

| Pitfall | Why it bites | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Skipping `mkcert -install` | Cert is generated but not trusted by the browser, silent iframe block | Run `mkcert -install` first. Re-open browsers after (Firefox especially caches trust). |
| Bare `next dev --experimental-https` (no key/cert flags) | Next generates its own self-signed cert not signed by mkcert's root CA, so the Studio iframe blocks silently | Pass the mkcert pair: `next dev --experimental-https --experimental-https-key ./certs/localhost-key.pem --experimental-https-cert ./certs/localhost.pem` |
| Cert files committed to git | Private key leaked | Always add `certs/` to `.gitignore` before generating |
| Generating cert for a different hostname than the dev URL | Cert mismatch, which produces a browser warning, which blocks the iframe | `mkcert ... localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1` covers all common localhost forms. Add other names if needed |
| `allowedHosts` set but headers missing | Vite serves the page but Studio can't frame it | Both `allowedHosts: true` AND the `frame-ancestors *` CSP header must be set. They solve different layers |
| Cert expired after ~825 days | mkcert certs are short-lived for security | Regenerate the cert pair. The root CA stays trusted |
| Re-installing mkcert after a system upgrade and re-running `mkcert -install` | Old cert pair was signed by the previous mkcert root CA which is no longer trusted | Regenerate the cert pair after re-installing mkcert |
| Using Mac App Store Chrome | Sandboxed. Sometimes ignores Keychain trust for system-installed CAs | Use the standalone Chrome download from google.com/chrome |
