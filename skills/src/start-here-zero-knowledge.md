## When to use

Zero-knowledge onboarding orchestrator. Walks new users through the conceptual ladder and nudges them to build their first real Section + Template.

Use as the VERY FIRST skill when a user says "I'm new to Studio", "what is Studio?", "I want to add Studio to my site", "how do I start with Studio", "show me Studio from scratch". Also defensively when `build-section` / `build-connected-template` is invoked by someone unfamiliar with Sections. Do NOT use as reference for someone who's shipped a Section.

> **Auth preflight: settle the credential before the first API call.** Resolve it OAuth-first per [`authenticate-cma`](authenticate-cma.md): `CS_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN`, else the Contentstack MCP's stored session. **Never ask the user for a session `authtoken`.** If nothing resolves, or a refresh fails with `400 invalid_refresh_token`, hand them `! CONTENTSTACK_REGION=<code> npx @contentstack/mcp --auth` (it needs a TTY and a browser, so it cannot be run for them) and wait. `403 error_code 316` is a valid credential aimed at another org: fix the org or the `api_key`, do **not** re-authenticate.

# Start here: Studio from zero

## Why this skill exists

Studio's value depends on a mental model the user must internalise BEFORE they start building. Skip it and they'll:

- Drop atomic components straight onto routes (one-off pages, no reuse)
- Hand-wire bindings per page (slow. Defeats the point)
- Build "Sections" as new React components in their repo (misunderstanding: Sections are composition data, not new code)
- Skip linked schemas (forfeits auto-binding. Back to manual wiring)
- Build N templates as N separate page routes (forfeits the catch-all + URL pattern reuse)

This skill is the on-ramp. It walks five concepts in 10 to 15 minutes, then routes to the right first action.

## Task

### Step 1: Frame the problem (no jargon yet)

Tell the user verbatim:

> Before any code, here's the problem Studio solves and the new vocabulary you'll need.
>
> **Today's problem.** Every new page on your site is engineering work. A new blog post, a new product, a campaign landing: each one is a route file + a component arrangement + data wiring. Marketing waits on engineering. Engineering rewrites the same hero-grid-CTA pattern for every layout. Adding a page = a deploy.
>
> **Studio's premise.** Engineers register your atomic React components ONCE. Authors then compose **Sections** (reusable parts of a page like a hero or a CTA strip, bound to CMS data once) and arrange those Sections into **Templates** (whole-page recipes). New pages = new entries in your CMS, not new code.
>
> The whole game is **bind once, reuse everywhere**. Sections and Templates are how Studio expresses that.

### Step 2: Walk the concept ladder (run each in order)

These seven concept skills explain the whole mental model, ~12 minutes total. Run in order. Each builds on the last:

1. **`understand-sections`**: what a Section is. The "part of a page" unit.
2. **`understand-linked-schemas`**: how a Section declares the data shape it needs.
3. **`understand-auto-binding`**: what happens when a Section drops on a Template. Why dropping "just works."
4. **`understand-section-slots`**: how to make ONE Section serve multiple Templates by leaving swap points open.
5. **`understand-templates`**: what a Template is and how Sections compose into one. Key mental-model rung: **Templates compose Sections.** A Template is a page-level container. Sections are the units that fill it. Build Sections first, then assemble them into a Template. Templates never model fields directly.
6. **`understand-canvas-vs-component`**: the two SDK mounts split by what they render: `<StudioCanvas />` is **Section-only** (one `/canvas` route, used inside Studio's iframe for Section building / authoring / previewing, Templates never render through it). `<StudioComponent />` renders **Templates**, on your real visitor routes AND inside Studio's template-preview iframe (Studio iframes the env Base URL + Template URL, which is the same route a visitor hits). Sections never render standalone. They only appear inside a Template.
7. **`understand-canvas-url`**: the Canvas URL field that comes up during setup (it points Studio at the `<StudioCanvas />` route used for Sections).

After these the user can answer in plain language: "A Section is a reusable part of a page with its CMS binding declared. A Template is a stack of Sections. When I drop a Section on a Template, Studio matches its linked schema to the Template's content type and auto-binds every prop. Section Slots let one Section serve many Templates with a child-component swap point. Sections author through `<StudioCanvas />` at the `/canvas` route inside Studio's iframe. Templates render through `<StudioComponent />` on my real routes: visitors hit those routes directly, and Studio iframes the same routes when previewing a Template."

### Step 3: Branch by project shape

Ask: **"Are you adding Studio to an existing website, or starting a brand-new one?"** Branch:

#### Path A: Existing website (most common)

The user already has a React app (Next/Vite/CRA/Remix), a Contentstack, and live content. Adding Studio is incremental.

Sequence:

1. `analyze-project-fit`: read-only diagnostic. Pins React 18 if needed, detects framework, picks the install branch.
2. `enable-visual-experience`: turn on Live Preview at the stack level (UI-only step).
3. `install-studio`: adds the three SDKs and wires the canonical init.
4. (Optional) `setup-local-https-canvas`: only if you need HTTPS-on-localhost for service workers / secure cookies / strict policy. Plain `http://localhost:<port>` works for the basic Studio iframe.
5. `setup-section-preview`: adds the `/canvas` route mounting `<StudioCanvas />`, sets Canvas URL.
6. `register-component`: register the user's first 3 to 5 atomic components (the ones they'll use in the first Section).
7. `build-section` (author the first Section. **Stop here and celebrate**) the first Section authored against real components is the moment Studio "clicks."
8. `setup-template-preview-routes`: add the catch-all (or dedicated route) that mounts `<StudioComponent />` for visitors.
9. `build-connected-template`: author the first Template against an existing content type, drop the Section on it.
10. `verify-setup`: run the layered smoke test.

After step 7 the user has proof the loop works (register, then Section, then render in canvas). After step 9 they have a live URL rendering a Template against their existing CMS data.

#### Path B: Brand-new website (greenfield)

The user is starting from scratch. They still need React + a CMS first.

Sequence:

1. Scaffold a React app (Vite + React 18 recommended, `npm create vite@latest -- --template react-ts` then pin to 18: `npm create vite@latest` defaults to React 19 today, which the SDK doesn't yet support. The SDK's `^18.0.0` peerDep will reject the install with an ERESOLVE error rather than silently installing and breaking at runtime, so the incompatibility surfaces immediately, but you still need to downgrade to React 18 before proceeding).
2. Set up a Contentstack with at least one content type that has fields you'll bind a Section to (e.g. `blog_post` with `title`, `subtitle`, `cover`, `body`).
3. Then run the same chain as Path A from `analyze-project-fit` onwards.

For Path B specifically: build 2 to 3 atomic components first (Hero, FeatureCard, CTA) so there's something to register in step 6. A `register-component` skill on a half-built component is wasted effort.

### Step 4: Set expectations

Tell the user verbatim:

> Two things you'll feel in the first hour:
>
> 1. **The first Section feels like overhead.** You register a component, declare a linked schema, then drop it once. Why didn't I just import the component on a page? Because the second time you use it on a different Template, you'll feel the payoff: zero re-wiring. By the fifth use it's a 10× return.
>
> 2. **You'll be tempted to skip Sections and bind components directly on Templates.** Don't. Template-level direct binding works for the Template you just authored, but the binding doesn't travel: when you make a similar Template tomorrow, you'll wire it again. Sections + linked schemas are what make today's binding usable tomorrow.
>
> If a part of a page appears on more than one Template, make it a Section. If you're not sure: make it a Section anyway. Downside is small.

### Step 5: Hand off to the first procedural skill

Print the user's tailored plan as a numbered list (from Step 3's appropriate path), and offer to invoke the first skill (`analyze-project-fit`). Wait for explicit user confirmation before any state-changing skill runs.

## Inputs needed from the user

1. `projectShape`: `existing` or `new`. Determines the branch in Step 3.

## Acceptance

This skill succeeds only when ALL of the following are true.

- [ ] The frame in Step 1 was printed (the user got the "problem and premise" narrative before any jargon).
- [ ] The user was guided through (or directly read) all six concept skills in Step 2, order matters: Sections, linked schemas, auto-binding, slots, Templates, then Canvas URL.
- [ ] The user confirmed their `projectShape`.
- [ ] The user received their branched, numbered plan (Path A or Path B).
- [ ] Step 4's expectation-setting was printed verbatim, both warnings (first-Section-feels-like-overhead, don't-skip-Sections).
- [ ] The user was nudged toward Sections + Templates rather than left to invent their own pattern.
- [ ] The user explicitly confirmed before any state-changing skill was invoked.

## Common pitfalls

| Pitfall | Why it bites | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Skipping the concept ladder and going straight to `install-studio` | User ends up wiring page-by-page, never realises Sections exist, ships a one-off integration that doesn't compound | Always run Step 2 first, even if the user is impatient. The 10-minute investment prevents weeks of rework. |
| Letting the user write Section-shaped React components in their repo | Sections are composition data, not new components. New React code "to be a Section" is wasted work. | Run `understand-sections`, make sure they see "a Section is composed from atomic components you already have." |
| Treating Path B (greenfield) as "easier" | It isn't: greenfield users still need a CMS stack with real content types and entries before Studio is meaningful. Empty stack = nothing to bind. | Step 3 Path B explicitly sequences CMS setup before Studio install. |
| Recommending `build-section` before `register-component` | A Section can't exist without registered atomic components to compose. | Path A step 6 (`register-component`) comes BEFORE step 7 (`build-section`). |
| Pushing the user toward complex setups (Section Slots, exposed props) on day one | These are advanced: premature complexity confuses new users | Keep the first chain to: register components, one Section, then one Connected Template. Section Slots and exposed props are post-success additions. |
