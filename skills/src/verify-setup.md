## When to use

Run a layered smoke test confirming Studio is wired correctly: Live Preview reachable, Visual Editor opens, Studio canvas loads the canvas-app fixture, and at least one composition renders.

Use right after `install-studio` and `setup-template-preview-routes` to catch breakage before authoring. Also when a previously working setup regressed ("the canvas was working yesterday"). Phrases: "verify Studio setup", "smoke test", "is Studio working". Do NOT use as a creative authoring skill: purely diagnostic. Does NOT replace `troubleshoot-canvas`: verify tells you WHAT is broken, troubleshoot tells you WHY.

> **Auth preflight: settle the credential before the first API call.** Resolve it OAuth-first per [`authenticate-cma`](authenticate-cma.md): `CS_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN`, else the Contentstack MCP's stored session. **Never ask the user for a session `authtoken`.** If nothing resolves, or a refresh fails with `400 invalid_refresh_token`, hand them `! CONTENTSTACK_REGION=<code> npx @contentstack/mcp --auth` (it needs a TTY and a browser, so it cannot be run for them), and wait. `403 error_code 316` is a valid credential aimed at another org: fix the org or the `api_key`, do **not** re-authenticate.

# Verify Studio setup end-to-end

## Context

Studio sits on top of three other systems: Delivery SDK, Live Preview, Visual Editor. A canvas that won't load is almost always one of those failing underneath. Walk the stack layer-by-layer to find the lowest failing layer.

The four layers, lowest-to-highest:

1. **Delivery SDK**: can the app fetch an entry from Contentstack at all?
2. **Live Preview**: does the iframe channel open between Contentstack and the app?
3. **Visual Editor**: does the entry-form UI render fields with edit markers?
4. **Studio**: does the canvas mount and render a composition with real bindings?

If layer 1 fails, layers 2 to 4 will all fail and chasing them is wasted work. Always read failures bottom-up.

Reference: `docs/10-setup/verify-end-to-end.md`, `docs/10-setup/troubleshoot-common-studio-issues.md`.

## Task

0. **Layer 0: Stack-level Visual Experience setup.**
   - Before testing any app-side wiring, ask the user to confirm ALL of:
     - `Settings → Visual Experience → General → Live Preview → Enable Live Preview` checkbox is **checked + Save clicked**
     - A `Default Preview Environment` is selected on the same page
     - The `Preview URL` sub-tab has a `Custom Preview URL` set (and is NOT showing the "Custom Preview URL Unavailable" lockout banner)
     - The Delivery Token in `.env` has a Preview Token generated (the **Create Preview Token** button on the token edit page must have been clicked at least once)
     - **The environment your Studio project targets has a non-empty per-locale URL** for your locale (in the stack, open Settings, then Environments, then `<env>`, and read the URL for `<locale>`). This is the canvas Base URL (origin). Empty = blank canvas with an error that points at the wrong layer. For local dev it must equal your dev origin (e.g. `http://localhost:5173`).
   - If any of these is unconfirmed (or the user is unsure), STOP and route them through `enable-visual-experience` (Live Preview) or `setup-section-preview` (the env Base URL). Re-run this skill after that completes.
   - Catches the most common failure: app wired, stack-level flag off, runtime silently broken. Skipping makes Layer 2 failures look like SDK bugs when they're actually web-app toggles.

1. **Layer 1: Delivery SDK reachability.**
   - Run: `npx tsx -e "import('@contentstack/delivery-sdk').then(async cs => { const stack = cs.default.stack({ apiKey: process.env.CS_API_KEY, deliveryToken: process.env.CS_DELIVERY_TOKEN, environment: process.env.CS_ENVIRONMENT || 'preview' }); const r = await stack.ctQuery('home_page', { limit: 1 }).find(); console.log('OK entries:', r.entries?.length ?? 0); })"`
   - Or, programmatically, call any existing `stack.ctQuery(<a known CT>).find()` in the app.
   - Pass: a query returns without throwing.
   - Fail modes: 401 means a wrong Delivery Token, 422 a wrong environment name, 404 a wrong CT UID, and ECONNREFUSED a wrong region host.

2. **Layer 2: Live Preview iframe channel.**
   - Open the host app at the Canvas URL in a browser.
   - In the host app, attach a one-off `ContentstackLivePreview.onEntryChange(() => console.log('lp:update'))` (or rely on an existing one). Make a content edit in Contentstack.
   - Pass: the callback fires within ~2s of the edit (you see `lp:update` in the host console).
   - Fail modes: no callback fire means the Preview Token is wrong, not generated yet, or Live Preview is not enabled on the stack. CORS errors in the console mean the app origin is not allowed in the Custom Preview URL config (re-verify under Visual Experience, then Preview URL). Don't inspect raw post-message event names: that's an internal channel that may change. The `onEntryChange` callback is the stable public surface.

3. **Layer 3: Visual Editor.**
   - In Contentstack web UI, open any entry of a CT whose template is mounted at the Canvas URL.
   - Click the "Preview" or eye icon, and the Visual Editor opens.
   - Pass: the entry preview shows, fields have hover-edit highlights, clicking a field opens its edit panel.
   - Fail modes: a blank iframe means the Canvas URL is wrong. Missing field highlights mean the `data-cslp` tags aren't being injected (the app isn't using `live-preview-utils` correctly).

4. **Layer 4: Studio canvas.**
   - Open Studio at `studioUrl`. Pick the project. Open any composition.
   - Pass: canvas iframe renders a non-empty `[data-composable-studio-id]` node tree within 10s.
   - Fail modes:
     - A blank canvas means the canvas iframe address is wrong. Check both halves: the **Canvas URL** (path) on the Studio project must match the mounted route, AND the **targeted environment's per-locale Base URL** (origin) must be non-empty and reachable. An empty env Base URL is the most common cause and surfaces as a "no base URL"-style error pointing at the Studio project, not the environment.
     - "Component Loading Error" means the section ref's `compositionUID` doesn't resolve (sections not preloaded or fetched from CDA, see F-018-style issues)
     - "Authentication failed" means the Delivery or Preview token in `.env` is wrong or revoked. In the stack, open Settings, then Tokens, then the token itself to read its current values, paste those into `.env`, and restart the dev server

   ### Expected (not-a-failure) console messages when verifying

   Two log lines are expected during verification and should NOT be interpreted as failures:

   - **`[StudioCanvas] is editing-only and renders nothing outside Composable Studio. Mount it on a dedicated route…`**: logged when you open the canvas route directly in a normal browser tab (outside Studio's iframe). `<StudioCanvas />` intentionally renders nothing without a parent Studio host to drive it. The route is verified by opening it INSIDE Studio's canvas, not by hitting its URL directly. A blank standalone page + this warning is expected.
   - **"SDK Not Initialized" tooltip inside Studio's canvas**: expected until step 3 of `install-studio` (bootstrap) has run + the browser can reach the canvas-app's origin. If you see it AFTER install: check that `studioSdk.init()` runs on the canvas route (the module holding init must be imported by that route's module tree) AND that the browser can reach the canvas-app (no mixed-content, no PNA block).

5. **Layer 5: New-user trap smoke tests** (runs after Layer 4 passes, catches the gaps that previously bit fresh installs).

   - **5a. Single-React check** (defends against the dual-React trap):
     ```bash
     <pm> ls react
     ```
     Pass: exactly one tree entry on `18.x`. Fail mode: more than one entry (a peer dep pulled a second copy), so see `analyze-project-fit` and `install-studio` React-pin step. (React 19 is blocked at install time by the SDK's `^18.0.0` peerDep. You shouldn't see it here.)

     **Caveat:** even with one React in `node_modules`, the canvas can see two React instances at runtime via Vite's dev optimizer pre-bundling the SDK with a separately-loaded React (different `?v=` hash). Fix is environmental. See 5a-bis.

   - **5a-bis. Canvas is served from a prod build, not the dev server.** Visit your `canvasAppUrl` and open the DevTools Network tab. Hard-reload. Check the first JS responses:
     - Pass: file names look like `assets/<chunkname>-<hash>.js` (Rollup output). One `react.js` bundle, no `?v=` query strings.
     - Fail: file names include `?v=<hash>` query strings (Vite dev-optimizer signature). Two or more separate React bundles confirm dual-React at runtime, so switch the canvas target from `vite` (dev) to `vite preview` (prod build). See `install-studio` step 9 and `setup-section-preview` for the config.

   - **5b. Local HTTPS reachability** (only if `canvasAppUrl` is `https://localhost*`):
     ```bash
     curl -I -sS --max-time 5 ${canvasAppUrl} 2>&1 | head -3
     ```
     Pass: `HTTP/2 200` (or `HTTP/1.1 200`) without any `self signed certificate` or `unable to get local issuer certificate` warning. Fail: an untrusted cert, so run `setup-local-https-canvas` (mkcert). An HTTP scheme on a Studio iframe produces mixed content. Switch to HTTPS.

   - **5c. iframe-allowed headers**:
     ```bash
     curl -I -sS --max-time 5 ${canvasAppUrl} | grep -iE 'content-security-policy|access-control-allow-origin'
     ```
     Pass: `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors *` AND `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` present. Fail: missing, so see `setup-section-preview` for the Vite/Next config block. The Studio iframe will silently fail to embed without these.

   - **5d. Arity ≥ 1 on every registered component**:
     ```bash
     grep -nE "registerComponent\(\{" -A 5 src/ lib/ | grep "component:" | head -20
     ```
     Manually inspect: every `component:` should either be a named component declared with at least one parameter (e.g. `function Hero(props) {…}`) or a wrapped form `(props) => createElement(Comp, props)`. Fail: any `component: Foo` where `Foo` is declared as `function Foo() {…}` (no parameter), which is the arity-0 trap and throws React #321 at render. See `register-component` arity rule. <!-- style-lint: allow -->

   - **5e. Connected-template URL match** (only if any connected templates exist):
     - Open any connected template in Studio. Confirm the canvas iframe renders (not "SDK Not Initialized").
     - If it fails, immediately apply the section-test diagnostic: open a section composition. If the section renders, the SDK is fine. The failure is the connected template's URL match. See `troubleshoot-composition-resolution` (entry `url` field needs a leading slash, and composition `url` must contain a `{{entry.x}}` pattern).
     - Also verify the env base URL scheme: in `GET /v3/environments/<env>`, `urls[].url` must be HTTPS if the canvas-app is HTTPS.

6. **Layer 6: Preview Token authenticates with the CDA preview API** (behavior-based, project-agnostic, does NOT assume any specific env file path or env var name).

   The most common silent failure on a fresh setup: the **Preview Token** passed to the Delivery SDK / Live Preview SDK is invalid or empty, the CDA preview API returns 401 without CORS headers, and the browser surfaces a misleading "CORS error" instead of "401 Unauthorized." Hours of CORS chasing for a token paste. Verify the token authenticates **before** opening Studio.

   **The check is project-agnostic.** Don't grep `.env.local`, don't assume `VITE_*` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` / `REACT_APP_*` env var names: every framework / project layout differs. Just ask the user for the three runtime values and curl-verify them directly. If you (the agent) can read the project's config to discover them, fine. Otherwise ask.

   Inputs:
   - `stackApiKey`: the stack's API key the canvas-app uses
   - `previewToken`: the Preview Token value the canvas-app currently passes to `@contentstack/live-preview-utils` / Delivery SDK at runtime, wherever it's loaded from (env file, runtime config, secrets manager, fetched-from-API, hardcoded, doesn't matter)
   - `previewHost`: region-dependent: `rest-preview.contentstack.com` (NA prod), `eu-rest-preview.contentstack.com` (EU prod), `azure-na-rest-preview.contentstack.com`, etc. (see `install-studio` § Regional host map). For non-prod / custom-cloud, take the host from [`analyze-project-fit`](analyze-project-fit.md) § 2b: Determine the data center (e.g. `dev11-rest-preview.csnonprod.com`) rather than asking again.
   - One `<CT>`, `<env>`, `<locale>` from the project to query against: pick any content type the user knows has at least one entry in that environment.

   Run:
   ```bash
   curl -is "https://${previewHost}/v3/content_types/${CT}/entries?environment=${env}&locale=${locale}&limit=1" \
     -H "api_key: ${stackApiKey}" \
     -H "preview_token: ${previewToken}"
   ```

   Outcomes:
   - **HTTP 200** + JSON `entries` array: **Pass**. The Preview Token authenticates. CORS headers WILL be present (`access-control-allow-origin: *`). Done. <!-- style-lint: allow -->
   - **HTTP 400** + `"Please provide live preview hash in request"`: still a **Pass**. The token authenticated. The 400 is just because curl didn't send the `live_preview` hash header the canvas-app SDK provides automatically at runtime.
   - **HTTP 401** + `"errors":{"preview_token":["is not valid."]}`: **Fail**. The Preview Token is bad. Common causes: literal string `"undefined"` from a provisioning script that couldn't mint via CMA, revoked (paired Delivery Token deleted), truncated copy-paste, wrong stack. Direct user to `troubleshoot-canvas` § CORS error on the CDA preview host row, plus `enable-visual-experience` Step 4 to mint / re-mint.
   - **HTTP 403**: **Fail**. The token is valid but lacks scope for that CT or environment. Direct user to Settings, then Tokens, to broaden scope.
   - **HTTP 422**: **Fail**. Environment or locale name typo.
   - **No CORS header on a 401 response** is normal Contentstack behavior. That's WHY the browser misattributes it as "CORS." Layer 6 sidesteps the browser entirely.

7. **Layer 7: Section scoping resolves correctly via the SSR cold-load** (only if the project has section compositions placed on any template). The most reliable headless check for section binding, bypasses the editor entirely.

   Section compositions are data-less standalone (their own canvas has no data, see `author-composition-via-api` § Authoring a Section composition). The editor canvas can't confirm a section's scope is correct. The SSR cold-load does: `await sdk.fetchCompositionData({ url, searchQuery })` runs the full data-collection + scoping pipeline and attaches `spec.data.section_scoped_data` (one entry per section instance) with the resolved `selectedField` and the actual scoped `template` slice.

   Inputs:
   - `previewUrl`: any visitor URL that resolves to a Connected Template that has sections placed on it (e.g. `https://localhost:3006/products/some-product`, `https://your-staging-site/blog/some-post`). The canvas-app must be running and reachable at this URL.

   Run (as a one-off Node script using the canvas-app's already-installed SDK):

   ```js
   import contentstack from "@contentstack/delivery-sdk";
   import { studioSdk } from "@contentstack/studio-react";

   // Replicate the canvas-app's stack init (whatever credentials it uses at runtime)
   const stack = contentstack.stack({
     apiKey:        process.env.STACK_API_KEY,
     deliveryToken: process.env.DELIVERY_TOKEN,
     environment:   process.env.ENV_NAME,
     live_preview:  { preview_token: process.env.PREVIEW_TOKEN, enable: true, host: process.env.PREVIEW_HOST },
   });

   const sdk = studioSdk.init({
     contentTypeUid: process.env.COMPOSITIONS_CT,   // whatever the project's compositions CT is
     stackSdk: stack,
   });

   // Throwaway verification script — no wrapper on purpose. A thrown
   // ComposableStudioError IS the result here: read err.id
   // (COMPOSITION_NOT_FOUND_BY_URL / PREVIEW_ENTRY_NOT_FOUND) and
   // err.details.troubleshootingInfo. In app code, wrap it — see
   // configure-csr-vs-ssr § "fetchCompositionData does not return not-found".
   const spec = await sdk.fetchCompositionData({ url: process.env.PREVIEW_URL });
   const scoped = (spec?.data ?? {}).section_scoped_data ?? {};

   for (const [instanceUid, data] of Object.entries(scoped)) {
     const tmpl = data.template;
     const len = Array.isArray(tmpl) ? tmpl.length : (tmpl ? 1 : 0);
     console.log(JSON.stringify({
       instanceUid,
       selectedField: data.selectedField,
       parentRepeaterUID: data.parentRepeaterUID,
       templateKind: Array.isArray(tmpl) ? "array" : typeof tmpl,
       templateLen: len,
       sample: Array.isArray(tmpl) ? tmpl.slice(0, 2).map(t => t?.title ?? t?.uid ?? "<no-title-or-uid>") : null,
     }));
   }
   ```

   `section_scoped_data[<instanceUid>]` carries:
   - `template`: the scoped slice the section actually renders against
   - `selectedField`: the resolved selectedField, taken from `sectionBindingOverride`, else `metadata.selectedField`, else the `linked_schemas` default, in that priority order
   - `parentRepeaterUID`: null at top level, set when the section was placed inside a Repeater
   - `contentstack`, `contentstack_queries`, `static_value`, `page`, `repeater`, `uidRemapping`, `componentPropsFallback`: full resolved data the section gets

   Per-instance pass/fail:

   | Outcome | What it means | Pass? |
   |---|---|---|
   | `selectedField` is set + `template` is an array of resolved entries with `templateLen > 0` | Section is correctly scoped to an iterated field, has data to render | Yes |
   | `selectedField` is unset/empty + `template` is the whole page entry (object, `templateKind: "object"`) | Whole-entry section (per P25's multi-field decision), correct for sections that read multiple page fields | Yes |
   | `selectedField` is set but `template` is `undefined` / null / empty array | Scope resolution failed. Reasons: `selectedField` points at a field that doesn't exist on the page CT, the field is empty on this preview entry, `data_sources.resolvedReferences` is missing for a reference path (see `author-composition-via-api` § Recipe: Repeat over a multi-reference). | No |
   | `selectedField` is set to one value but you EXPECTED another | The `linked_schemas` vs `sectionBindingOverride` paths disagree, OR the section's `linked_schemas` was dropped by the compositions CT (the linked_schemas-as-reference trap, P23). Compare both paths. Both must agree. | No |
   | `Object.keys(scoped).length === 0` but the template HAS section nodes in its `ui` | The composition's `linked_sections` reference field isn't populated (P27 territory: API-placed sections need this reference set even though SSR walks the `section-composition` nodes itself). | No |

   Direct user to `author-composition-via-api` § Authoring a Section composition: scoping rules for fix paths on any **No** row.

8. **Report.** Print each layer as a pass or a fail, with the exact failing call. If everything passes, print "All seven layers green. Canvas URL: <canvasAppUrl>". If anything fails, name the LOWEST failing layer and suggest invoking `troubleshoot-canvas` (or for Layer 7, `author-composition-via-api`) with that symptom.

## Inputs needed from the user

1. `canvasAppUrl`: used in Layer 2 (open in browser) + Layer 4 (compare against Studio project config).
2. `studioUrl`: used in Layer 4.
3. `stackApiKey`: used in Layer 6 (curl against preview API).
4. `previewToken`: used in Layer 6. Whatever value the canvas-app currently passes to the Delivery / Live Preview SDK at runtime, wherever the project loads it from (env file, runtime config, secrets manager, hardcoded). If unsure, ask the user to read it from their project's config layer. Do NOT assume an env file path or variable name.
5. `previewHost`: used in Layer 6. Region-dependent (see `install-studio` § Regional host map). For non-prod / custom-cloud, the explicit host the user gives you (e.g. `dev11-rest-preview.csnonprod.com`).
6. One `<CT>`, `<env>`, `<locale>` triple: used in Layer 6 as a known-good probe target. Any content type the user knows has at least one entry in that environment.
7. `previewUrl`: used in Layer 7. Any visitor URL on the canvas-app that resolves to a Connected Template with sections placed on it (e.g. `http://localhost:3006/products/some-product` for local dev). Skip Layer 7 if the project has no section compositions placed on any template yet.

If `.env` exists in the project, read `CANVAS_APP_BASE_URL` and `STUDIO_BASE_URL` as defaults for the first two before asking. Do NOT auto-read `previewToken` from any env file: its location is project-specific.

## Acceptance

This skill succeeds only when Layer 0 + ALL seven downstream layers were attempted (Layer 7 may be skipped if the project has no section compositions placed on any template) and a clear pass/fail recorded for each.

- [ ] Layer 0 confirmed (Enable Live Preview checked + Default Preview Environment set + Custom Preview URL set + Preview Token created on the Delivery Token + targeted environment has a non-empty per-locale Base URL).
- [ ] Layer 1 result reported (delivery SDK call result or HTTP status code).
- [ ] Layer 2 result reported (live-preview event seen / not seen within timeout).
- [ ] Layer 3 result reported (entry preview opens / fails / can't even open the entry).
- [ ] Layer 4 result reported (canvas DOM tree present in the iframe / not present / specific error string).
- [ ] Layer 5 smoke tests reported: single-React, local HTTPS, iframe-allowed headers, arity-of-registered-components, connected-template URL match (where applicable). Any failure flagged with the skill to invoke next.
- [ ] Layer 6 reported: Preview Token authenticated against the CDA preview host (HTTP 200 or HTTP 400-with-live-preview-hash-message = PASS, HTTP 401/403/422 = FAIL with the specific fix path identified). Behavior-based check, project-specific env layout was NOT assumed.
- [ ] Layer 7 reported (or skipped with explicit reason: "no section compositions placed on any template"): for every section instance in `spec.data.section_scoped_data`, the resolved `selectedField` and `template` shape match expectations. Any failing instance is named with the specific failure class (undefined template, wrong selectedField, missing linked_sections, etc.) and routed to `author-composition-via-api` for the fix.
- [ ] If any layer failed: the LOWEST failing layer is named, not the highest visible symptom.
- [ ] If everything passed: the all-clear message + canvas URL is printed.

## Common pitfalls

| Pitfall | Why it bites | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reporting "Studio canvas is broken" when Layer 1 is failing | Layer 4 failures are downstream of every layer below: Studio gets blamed for SDK auth issues | Always report the LOWEST failing layer, not the most visible symptom |
| Confusing Live Preview enable on the stack vs Live Preview install in the app | The stack-level flag controls if the channel exists. The app must also install `@contentstack/live-preview-utils` | Both must be true. In the stack, the flag is under Settings, then Visual Experience, then General. App install is in `package.json`. |
| Confusing Canvas URL (project-level, Studio) with the Custom Preview URL (stack-level, Visual Editor) | Two different settings. Setting one doesn't set the other | Canvas URL is in Studio, under Project, then Settings. Custom Preview URL is in the stack, under Settings, then Visual Experience. |
| Treating Canvas URL as a full origin (e.g. `http://localhost:5173/canvas`) | Canvas URL is the **path only** (`/canvas`). The origin is the environment's per-locale Base URL. A full URL here breaks the composed iframe address. | Canvas URL is the path. The origin comes from the stack, under Settings, then Environments, then `<env>`, as the URL for `<locale>`. |
| Skipping Layer 1 because "the credentials worked yesterday" | Delivery / Preview tokens can be revoked or rotated, and the failure is silent until the next request | Always re-run Layer 1, it takes 2 seconds |
| Marking Layer 4 as "fail" when the canvas is blank because nothing has been authored yet | Empty canvas is normal for a new composition | Check Layers panel: empty Layers = unauthored, fine. Non-empty Layers + blank canvas = real failure. |
