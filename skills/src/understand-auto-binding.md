## When to use

Explain how Studio auto-renders data when a Section drops on a template, the algorithm matching the Section's linked schema to the template's content type.

Use after `understand-linked-schemas` when the user asks "how does data appear?", "do I have to wire bindings by hand?", "why did my Section render empty when dropped?". Also before `build-connected-template` so the user knows what happens at the drop. Do NOT use to wire bindings: for that, see `wire-external-data` / `build-connected-template`.

> **Mandatory auth preflight: settle the credential before the first API call.** Resolve it OAuth-first per [`authenticate-cma`](authenticate-cma.md): `CS_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN`, else the Contentstack MCP's stored session. **Never ask the user for a session `authtoken`.** If nothing resolves, or a refresh fails with `400 invalid_refresh_token`, hand them `! CONTENTSTACK_REGION=<code> npx @contentstack/mcp --auth` (it needs a TTY and a browser, so it cannot be run for them) and wait. `403 error_code 316` is a valid credential aimed at another org: fix the org or the `api_key`, do **not** re-authenticate.

# How auto-binding works

## The one-line answer

**When you drop a Section onto a template, Studio reads the Section's linked schema, looks at the template's connected content type, and pairs every Section prop with the matching CT field automatically, no manual wiring per drop.** The Section then renders against a real entry as soon as it lands.

This is what makes Sections worth using. Without it, reuse would be theoretical: you'd re-wire every drop.

## What "auto" actually means

Three things happen the instant you release the drag:

1. **Schema match**: Studio compares the Section's linked schema to the connected content type's fields, by **field UID**, **field type**, and **required-ness** (see `understand-linked-schemas`).
2. **Binding**: for every linked-schema entry that finds a CT field match, Studio writes the binding (`prop ← field.uid`) into the template instance.
3. **Render**: the Section's atomic React components receive the bound data from the **preview entry** Studio fetches (top-bar PREVIEW ENTRY in the canvas) and render immediately against that real content.

No save, no refresh, no manual binding click. The canvas redraws with real CMS data the second the drop completes.

## A concrete walkthrough

You have a `blog_post` content type with fields: `title`, `subtitle`, `body`, `cover`, `author`, `publish_date`.

You have a Section called `BlogArticleHeader` whose linked schema is:

```
title:    Single Line, required
subtitle: Multi Line,  optional
cover:    File,         required
```

You create a connected template against `blog_post` and drag `BlogArticleHeader` onto the empty canvas. At drop time Studio:

| Section prop | Matches CT field? | Binding written |
|---|---|---|
| `title` | yes (`blog_post.title`) | `props.title ← entry.title` |
| `subtitle` | yes (`blog_post.subtitle`) | `props.subtitle ← entry.subtitle` |
| `cover` | yes (`blog_post.cover`) | `props.cover ← entry.cover.url` (see Multiple-file note below) |

The PREVIEW ENTRY in the canvas top bar is auto-set to the most recently updated `blog_post`. The Section renders its hero card with the entry's actual title, subtitle, and cover image. **Zero clicks beyond the drop.**

## What "scope" means and why it changes the match

The matching scope is whichever content level you're inside when you drop the Section. There are three common scopes:

| Drop scope | What the Section binds against | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Page root** | The template's connected content type, top-level fields on the preview entry | Drop `BlogArticleHeader` straight onto a blog-post template, so it binds to top-level `blog_post` fields |
| **Inside a Repeater** bound to a reference / Modular Block | The repeated item's shape (each loop iteration is one referenced entry / one block) | Drop `RelatedPostCard` inside a Repeater bound to `blog_post.related_posts`, so it binds to each `related_post` entry's fields, not the parent post's |
| **Inside a Section Slot** | The slot's host scope (usually the same as the Section the slot lives in) | Drop a `Button` into a `cta` slot inside a hero Section, so it binds against the hero Section's host scope |

Drop scope matters because the same Section dropped at page root vs inside a Repeater binds to different fields. The Repeater changes the field reference frame to the iteration item. Studio handles this automatically. You don't choose the scope: it's wherever your drag-and-drop lands on the canvas.

## What happens when auto-binding can't find a match

| Situation | What Studio does | Author's next step |
|---|---|---|
| Required prop has no matching CT field | Section drops unbound with a red warning in right-panel Settings | Either add the missing field to the CT, or pick a compatible field manually from the dropdown |
| Optional prop has no matching CT field | Section drops, that prop renders empty | Usually leave alone. It's optional |
| Multiple CT fields could match (e.g. both `title` and `headline` are Single Line Text) | Section drops bound to one (first match wins). Right-panel Settings shows the dropdown to switch | Switch the binding via the dropdown |
| The Section's linked schema is empty | Section drops fully unbound: Studio can't infer anything | Either author the linked schema (recommended), or bind each prop manually per template (works but loses reuse benefits) |

## What changes for the visitor at runtime

Nothing extra. The same auto-bound prop references that Studio's canvas renders against become the live-site renderer's data fetch. `sdk.fetchCompositionData({ url })` returns the composition spec **with bindings resolved**. `<StudioComponent />` reads the prop values from the fetched entry and renders. The visitor sees the same content the canvas does, same render path.

## Why this matters

| Without auto-binding | With auto-binding |
|---|---|
| Every Section drop requires 5 to 15 manual bindings | Drops "just work" if the CT shape matches |
| Section reuse loses 80% of its value to wiring overhead | Section reuse delivers the full speed benefit |
| Authors must understand the React prop names | Authors don't need to know prop names: they only see CT fields |
| Renaming a CMS field breaks N templates silently | Linked schema is the single source of truth: fix once, everywhere re-binds |
| New template against same CT = re-wire every Section | New template = instant productivity |

This is why "Studio is to your Components what your CMS is to your Content" works: the same way a CMS treats content as data that snaps into shapes, Studio treats composition as data that snaps onto content shapes.

## How to inspect what auto-binding did

After dropping a Section on a template:

- **Right-panel Settings tab**: shows each prop with its current binding chip. Green = bound, red = unbound.
- **Right-panel Data tab** (when a sub-component is selected): shows the data picker. The current binding appears in the picker breadcrumb.
- **Layers panel**: every node is selectable. Clicking any shows its bindings in the right panel.

If something rendered empty, the right panel tells you which prop didn't bind and to what.

**Note on what you see on the canvas:** auto-binding wires the props at drop time, but the canvas renders defaults until Preview Mode is toggled. Seeing defaults isn't a binding failure. See `use-repeater` for the two-mode mental model.

## What can go wrong (real failure modes)

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Section renders blank even though the entry has content | A `file` (multiple) field bound directly to a scalar `imageurl` prop | Bind to `field.0.url` instead (see `wire-external-data`) |
| Section auto-binds but renders the wrong field | Two fields had matching UIDs. First match wins | Switch the binding in the right-panel Settings dropdown |
| Section drops unbound on a CT that "looks right" | Field UIDs differ (`title` vs `headline`) | Rename the CT field OR change the Section's linked schema to match, best to align on convention |
| Repeater renders only one row | Repeater isn't bound to an array field, or the binding scope is wrong | See `use-repeater` |

## Data-flow at render time: `selectedField` re-scopes the section

Drop-scope (page / Repeater / Slot) is what this skill covers: the UI-level "where did I drop it, what fields are visible." A separate mechanism runs at render time: `getScopedData(pageEntry, selectedField)` on the Section's linked-schema entry. When `selectedField` is set, the Section's `template` becomes that one field's value. When it is unset, `template` is the whole page entry. The Section's own canvas always shows one empty placeholder because the scoping only happens at template-render time. See [`build-section`](build-section.md) § How a Section gets its data for the set-vs-unset decision rule.
