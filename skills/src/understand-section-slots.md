## When to use

Explain Section Slots: designated swap points inside a Section where a template author drops a different Section per instance without forking. Section-in-Slot, not raw component.

Use before `use-section-slot` when the user is new to Studio. Also when the user asks "what's a Section Slot?", "do I need a new Section for X?", or is stuck between forking a Section vs exposing a slot. Phrases: "what's a slot", "swap point", "drop zone". Do NOT use to actually create a slot. For that, run `use-section-slot`.

> **Auth preflight: settle the credential before the first API call.** Resolve it OAuth-first per [`authenticate-cma`](authenticate-cma.md): `CS_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN`, else the Contentstack MCP's stored session. **Never ask the user for a session `authtoken`.** If nothing resolves, or a refresh fails with `400 invalid_refresh_token`, hand them `! CONTENTSTACK_REGION=<code> npx @contentstack/mcp --auth` (it needs a TTY and a browser, so it cannot be run for them) and wait. `403 error_code 316` is a valid credential aimed at another org: fix the org or the `api_key`, do **not** re-authenticate.

# What is a Section Slot?

## "Slot" lives at two layers: read this first

Studio uses the word "Slot" at two different layers. They compose, but they're distinct mechanisms. This skill teaches the second one. You'll see references to the first one too.

| Layer | Name | Where it's declared | Who declares it | Skill |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Component schema** | `slot`-typed prop | In `registerComponent({ props: { body: { type: "slot" } } })` | The engineer registering a component | `register-component` § 5a |
| **Section composition** | **Section Slot** | A Smart Container element carved into a Section's tree | The author building a Section | This skill + `use-section-slot` |

**They compose together.** Canonical pattern:
1. An engineer registers a `Card` component with a `body: { type: "slot" }` prop (component-level extensibility).
2. The section author carves a **Section Slot** inside that `body` region of the Card on the section canvas (section-level extensibility, see `use-section-slot` § component-slot-prop placement).
3. Template authors drop another Section into the Section Slot at template-authoring time (per-template extensibility).

Three layers of extensibility working together. If you just want to skim: most authoring decisions in this skill are about layer 2 (Section Slot). The component-level `slot` prop is a separate engineer-side concern documented in `register-component`.

## The one-line answer

**A Section Slot is a placeholder inside a Section that template authors can fill with a different component per template instance.** It's how you make one Section work for multiple template layouts without copy-pasting the Section N times.

## A real example

You have one Section called **"Hero Strip"**, a banner with a title and a CTA area on the right. You use it on three pages:

- Marketing landing pages need a **Button** in the CTA area (`Get started →`)
- Blog post pages need a **Subscribe form** in the CTA area (email input + submit)
- Product detail pages need an **Add to cart** widget in the CTA area

All three pages share the same Hero Strip layout (same title position, same background, same spacing) but want a different component on the right.

Without slots: three separate Sections (`HeroStripWithButton`, `HeroStripWithSubscribe`, `HeroStripWithCart`) that drift apart over time.

**With a Section Slot:** one Hero Strip Section with a slot called `cta`. Template authors drop a Button into the slot on the marketing template, a Subscribe form on the blog template, an Add to Cart on the product template. One Section, three template layouts.

## The mental model

A Section Slot is **a designated placeholder** in the composed React tree:

```
Section "HeroStrip"
├── Title (bound to entry.title)
├── Background image (bound to entry.background)
└── Section Slot "cta"   ← template author drops a component here
```

When a template uses this Section, the slot is empty until the author drags something into the outlined region on the canvas. Drop a `Button`, and Studio renders `Button` inside the slot for that template. The next template can drop something else.

## What fills a Slot: a Section, not a raw component

A Slot is filled at template-authoring time by **dropping another Section into it**, not a raw registered component. This matters because of how binding works:

- A **Section** is already bound to its own linked schema. When it lands in a Slot, its bindings come along: the dropped Section knows what data it renders without the author touching any prop. Studio auto-binds the Section's linked schema to whatever data scope the Slot sits in (e.g. an iterated item if the Slot is inside a Repeater).
- A **raw registered component** has only prop signatures. Studio has no way to know which field maps to which prop at the Slot location. The author would have to hand-bind every prop through the Data Picker. That's the wrong granularity for a Section Slot.

So the recipe is: **build the child as its own Section**, with its own linked schema, then drop that Section into the parent's Slot. One drop, no per-prop binding clicks.

In the Hero Strip example, the CTA-area variations are each their own Section: a "CTA Button" Section bound to a button content shape, a "Subscribe Form" Section bound to a subscription content shape, etc. The template author drops the appropriate Section into the `cta` slot, and Studio handles the wiring.

## Slot vs Exposed Prop: when do I use which?


| Section Slot | Exposed Prop |
|---|---|
| Swap a **child component** (Button vs Form vs Cart widget) | Override a **value on an existing prop** (button label = "Buy" vs "Get started") |
| The shape of the inner UI changes | The content of an existing prop changes |
| Template author drags a different component into the slot | Template author types a value in the right-panel Settings tab |
| Adds a tree-shape variation point | Adds a per-template content override |

Use **a slot** when the kind of thing varies per template. Use **an exposed prop** when only the value of an existing thing varies.

## When to expose one: the Global Field / Modular Block / Group / Reference heuristic

The strongest, most reliable signal that a Section should expose a Slot is the **shape of the CT it's bound to**. If your CT has any **Global Field**, **Modular Block**, **Group**, or **Reference** field, the corresponding Section should expose a Slot for it: those fields are inherently composable / reusable, and inlining them into the parent Section throws that reusability away.

**Global Fields are the strongest candidate of all**: they exist because the same field set is meant to be reused across multiple content types. If a CT embeds a Global Field, that Global Field almost always deserves its own Section (built against the Global Field schema directly) which the parent Section then exposes as a Slot. Inlining a Global Field's children into the parent Section duplicates work every team that uses the same Global Field elsewhere will also have to do.

Why the rest qualify: each of those field kinds already represents another unit of structured content that other Sections can be built against. A Modular Block can be filled with different block types per entry. A Group / Reference points at a nested shape that any compatible Section can render. Exposing them as Slots lets the parent Section be filled with a different child Section per usage: same parent layout, different inner content shape. Inlining them locks in one shape forever.

**Rule of thumb:** for every Global Field / Modular Block / Group / Reference field on the CT, default to exposing a Slot in the Section. Override only when you are certain that nested shape is genuinely one-off and never going to vary, and even then, Global Fields rarely qualify for the override (their whole reason for existing is cross-CT reuse).

## When to add a Slot to a Section

Add a Section Slot when ALL three are true:

1. **The same Section layout** is used on multiple templates.
2. **One specific child component** needs to differ per template.
3. The different components share enough role/space that they fit in the same outlined region (a Button and a Form both go in "CTA area". A Button and a 600px-tall video grid don't).

If only the value differs (button label, image URL), use an Exposed Prop instead: slots are heavier (they require the inner component to be droppable in Studio).

If every template uses a different layout shape, the Sections probably aren't really the same. Consider separate Sections.

## What a Slot does NOT do

| Misconception | Reality |
|---|---|
| "A slot binds to CMS data" | No. The slot itself doesn't have a binding. The Section dropped INTO the slot brings its own bindings (via its linked schema). |
| "I drop a registered component into the slot and it just works" | No. Raw components have no bindings. The author would have to hand-bind every prop through the Data Picker. Drop a **Section** into the slot instead: Sections come pre-bound to their linked schema, so Studio auto-binds at the Section level. |
| "Slots have to be filled" | No. An empty slot just renders nothing. Templates that don't need the slot leave it empty. |
| "I should add a slot everywhere just in case" | No. Slots add authoring surface area and complexity. Add one only when you have a real per-template-component-variation need. |
| "A slot is the same as the React children prop" | Conceptually similar, but a Section Slot is a named drop target in Studio's authoring UI: authors can find it by name in the canvas. The React `children` prop is the rendering mechanism underneath. |

## How slots appear in Studio

- **Inside the Section's canvas** (when you're authoring the Section), the slot shows as an outlined region with the slot name as a label.
- **When the Section is dropped on a template**, the slot appears in the same outlined region, droppable, empty until filled.
- **From the right-panel Layers tree**, the slot is a node you can select to inspect.
- **Studio Slot vs Section Slot terminology:** they're the same thing. Studio's docs sometimes use "Section Slot" to disambiguate from React's `children` slot pattern.
