## When to use

Bump the Studio SDK packages (studio-react, studio-react-components, studio-client, studio-registry, studio-core, studio-internal, studio-react-editor) in the host app: pin versions, read CHANGELOGs, smoke-check, roll back if needed.

Use when the user wants to upgrade the Studio SDK packages in their host app: "upgrade Studio SDK to latest", "what's new in `@contentstack/studio-react`", "is `studio-client@1.5` safe", "I want the new repeater fix". Do NOT use to install for the first time (`install-studio`). Do NOT use to develop the SDK itself.

> **Auth preflight: settle the credential before the first API call.** Resolve it OAuth-first per [`authenticate-cma`](authenticate-cma.md): `CS_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN`, else the Contentstack MCP's stored session. **Never ask the user for a session `authtoken`.** If nothing resolves, or a refresh fails with `400 invalid_refresh_token`, hand them `! CONTENTSTACK_REGION=<code> npx @contentstack/mcp --auth` (it needs a TTY and a browser, so it cannot be run for them) and wait. `403 error_code 316` is a valid credential aimed at another org: fix the org or the `api_key`, do **not** re-authenticate.

# Upgrade the Studio SDK packages

## Context

The Studio SDK is a multi-package monorepo published as independent versions per package (lerna `versioning: independent`). The packages a host app typically installs are:

| Package | Role | Recent versions |
|---|---|---|
| `@contentstack/studio-react` | Renderer + hooks (`StudioComponent`, `useCompositionData`, registration entry points) | `1.3.x` |
| `@contentstack/studio-react-components` | Built-in basics (Page, Section, Text, Repeater, ConditionBlock, …), `"use client"` modules | `1.5.x` |
| `@contentstack/studio-client` | CDA/CMA orchestration: `fetchCompositionData`, `fetchSpec`, URL resolution | `1.5.x` |
| `@contentstack/studio-registry` | `ComponentRegistry`, `DesignRegistry`, data-binder, globalThis singleton | `1.4.x` |
| `@contentstack/studio-core` | Internal core: light SDK init, font loading, design-token cascade | `1.1.x` |
| `@contentstack/studio-internal` | Internal types + apply/transform helpers | `1.2.x` |
| `@contentstack/studio-react-editor` | The edit-mode renderer (`StudioCanvas`'s renderer) | `1.3.x` |

Versions follow [SemVer](https://semver.org). Changelogs are committed per package in the SDK repo and follow Conventional Commits: entries are grouped by `feat` / `fix` / `perf` / `refactor`. There is no separate "Breaking Changes" section. Treat any minor-version bump that involves cross-package work (registry, renderer, basics together) as carrying coordination risk.

The `peerDependencies` are `react ^18.0.0` and `react-dom ^18.0.0`. React 19 is unsupported and blocked at install time by npm/pnpm. The SDK packages also depend on each other internally. Mixing major versions across them is unsupported.

## Task

1. **Capture current state.**
   - `cat package.json | grep '"@contentstack/studio'` in the host app to see currently pinned ranges.
   - `npm ls @contentstack/studio-react @contentstack/studio-react-components @contentstack/studio-client @contentstack/studio-registry @contentstack/studio-core @contentstack/studio-internal @contentstack/studio-react-editor` to see the actually-resolved versions.
   - If the lockfile is missing or stale, also run `npm view @contentstack/studio-react versions --json | tail` to see what's published.

2. **Read the CHANGELOG delta: actually read it.**
   - For each package the host app installs, open its CHANGELOG and read every entry from the installed version up to the target. Do not summarize from imagination. Copy or paraphrase actual entries.
   - The studio-client CHANGELOG lives at `node_modules/@contentstack/studio-client/CHANGELOG.md` on the consumer side. Same for the other packages.
   - Flag any entry that touches: registry singleton, SSR / `"use client"` boundary, `fetchSpec` / `fetchCompositionData` signatures, URL pattern compilation, design-token / font loading, data-binder type-mismatch. Those are the ones most likely to surface integration friction even when the bump is technically non-breaking.

3. **Upgrade together, not piecemeal.** Bump all Studio SDK packages installed by the host in the same change. Mixing, say, `studio-react@1.3` with `studio-registry@1.2` risks the registry-singleton API drift (the globalThis-backed singleton landed across packages in coordinated bumps).
   - Pick the exact versions (avoid `^` for the upgrade commit so the resolved versions are reproducible. You can relax to `^` after smoke passes).
   - Run `npm install @contentstack/studio-react@<v> @contentstack/studio-react-components@<v> @contentstack/studio-client@<v> @contentstack/studio-registry@<v> @contentstack/studio-core@<v> @contentstack/studio-internal@<v> @contentstack/studio-react-editor@<v>` (or the matching `pnpm` / `yarn` form). Use `--save-exact` if you want the upgrade-commit to pin exact versions.

4. **Smoke-test the host app.** Concrete steps depend on the framework. The matrix below is the minimum surface that catches the common breakages.

   | Framework | Smoke steps |
   |---|---|
   | `next-app` | Run `npm run build` (it catches `"use client"` boundary errors at compile), then `npm start`, then load a Connected Template URL. In the DevTools console: no errors, no `useData` warnings in production. In the DevTools Network tab: confirm composition + entry queries return 200. |
   | `next-pages` | Run `npm run build`, then load a composition route, and confirm no console errors. |
   | `vite-spa` | Run `npm run build && npm run preview`, then load a composition URL, confirm the console is clean, and check `<StudioCanvas>` mounts on the canvas route. |
   | `remix` | Run `npm run build` (the loader-side fetch must compile), then load a composition URL, and ensure the server fetch passes `searchQuery`. |

   Across all frameworks: re-check the canvas route (`/canvas` or equivalent) separately. The canvas-route renderer has historically had built-in registration regressions that don't always surface on `<StudioComponent>` routes (see the corresponding `troubleshoot-canvas` row).

5. **If something breaks.** Match the symptom to the troubleshooting skill: `troubleshoot-ssr-rendering` for boundary errors, `troubleshoot-data-binding` for binding drift, `troubleshoot-composition-resolution` for live-site URL behavior, `troubleshoot-canvas` for editor iframe. Almost every recent SDK regression has a corresponding row in one of those skills.

6. **Rollback path** (concrete. Do not skip in production).
   - Revert `package.json` and the lockfile to the pre-upgrade commit (`git checkout HEAD~1 -- package.json package-lock.json`).
   - `rm -rf node_modules && npm install` (don't try to selectively downgrade: lockfile reconciliation across the seven packages is unreliable).
   - Re-run the smoke check. If you can't get back to a working state with a hard revert, escalate.

## Knowing what actually changed

Each package publishes a CHANGELOG derived from Conventional Commits. Read the CHANGELOG for every package in your delta before upgrading.

A non-exhaustive list of changes that historically required consumer-side action (read each from its CHANGELOG before claiming it applies to your delta):

- **Registry singleton moved to `globalThis`** (`studio-registry` / `studio-react` coordinated bump): required for RSC server-side fetch to see registered components. If you're upgrading FROM a pre-singleton version TO a post-singleton version, server-side `fetchSpec` calls that used to return "component not registered" will now resolve. No consumer code change beyond the upgrade.
- **Basics moved behind a `"use client"` isolation boundary** (`studio-react`): fixes "Attempted to call Page() from the server" in Next App Router. No consumer code change required. The renderer pulls in the client-only basics automatically.
- **Tolerant `useData` fallback** (`studio-react-components`): replaces a throw with an empty-data fallback plus a dev-only warning. SSR pass of basics no longer crashes outside a `DataCtxProvider`. Consumer-side: dev console may show one new warning, production unchanged.
- **`fetchCompositionData` requires `searchQuery` on the server**: see [`configure-csr-vs-ssr.md`](configure-csr-vs-ssr.md). Required for locale/variant/preview to flow from Studio's iframe params. Pre-existing as an integration step.

Do NOT extrapolate from this list. **Only the actual CHANGELOG entries for your delta** tell you which of these apply.

## What this skill is NOT

- Not a guide to first-time installation (use [`install-studio`](install-studio.md)).
- Not a guide to SDK-internal development.
- Not a substitute for reading the CHANGELOG. Always read the actual CHANGELOG entries for your version delta.
- Not a guide to upgrading the Contentstack Delivery SDK (`@contentstack/delivery-sdk`) or Live Preview Utils (`@contentstack/live-preview-utils`): those are separate packages with their own CHANGELOGs, only loosely coupled to the Studio SDK.
