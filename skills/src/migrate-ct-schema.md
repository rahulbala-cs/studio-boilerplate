## When to use

Change a live Content Type's schema (add fields, rename, retype, remove, extract to Global Field) safely. Every change classified by risk. Safe changes (additive) applied directly, unsafe changes (rename, retype, remove) planned as dual-write + backfill + cutover. Dry-run mandatory before any live change. State file records every intended mutation so the run resumes on failure or reverts on demand.

Use when a live CT needs to evolve: field added post-launch, prop renamed to match new component signature, a group extracted into a reusable Global Field, a Reference retargeted from one CT to another. Phrases: "add a field to `blog_post`", "rename `title` to `headline`", "extract `hero` to a Global Field", "change `read_time` from string to number", "migrate CT schema". Do NOT use for initial CT creation (that's [`provision-studio-stack`](provision-studio-stack.md)) or for content-only migrations (that's [`import-content`](import-content.md)).

> **Auth preflight: settle the credential before the first API call.** Resolve it OAuth-first per [`authenticate-cma`](authenticate-cma.md): `CS_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN`, else the Contentstack MCP's stored session. **Never ask the user for a session `authtoken`.** If nothing resolves, or a refresh fails with `400 invalid_refresh_token`, hand them `! CONTENTSTACK_REGION=<code> npx @contentstack/mcp --auth` (it needs a TTY and a browser, so it cannot be run for them) and wait. `403 error_code 316` is a valid credential aimed at another org: fix the org or the `api_key`, do **not** re-authenticate.

# Migrate a Content Type schema: dry-run planned, dual-write executed, rollback documented

> ## Verification status
>
> **Core mechanics runtime-verified against a live stack.** Some risk-table rows (destructive rename, incompatible retype) remain pattern-verified only. Always dry-run on a staging stack before production.
>
> - CMA endpoints (`/v3/content_types/<uid>`, entry backfill endpoints) match existing verified skills.
> - Retry + state-file pattern matches [`agent-idempotency`](../../docs/50-advanced/agent-idempotency.md) reference implementation.
> - **Safe additive (add optional field), dual-write pattern (add parallel field for rename), bulk entry backfill via PUT, and rollback via schema PUT are all runtime-verified end-to-end** against a live Contentstack stack. 17/17 structural claims pass: schema shape changes, entries survive rollback with core field data intact. Reproduce with `npx ts-node scripts/verify-migrate-ct-schema.ts` (requires `CS_API_KEY` + `CS_AUTH_TOKEN` in `.env`).
>
> **Best practice: always dry-run on a staging stack** with the exact CT + entries first. Never run a high-risk migration against production the first time. Incompatible-retype and in-place destructive renames are explicitly discouraged in the risk-classification table below in favour of the verified dual-write path. The 14-day cool-off is a suggested default. Tune to your release cadence.

## Context

The three CT-schema failure modes an agent must not commit blind:

1. **Add a required field to a CT with entries.** Live entries have no value, so Contentstack rejects the CT update. Silent failure or partial rollout.
2. **Rename a field.** Entries still carry the old field name. Existing bindings on Sections point at the old name. The new name is empty. Live site breaks on first render.
3. **Retype a field.** Existing values don't match the new type, so Contentstack drops them silently or rejects the update. Content vanishes.

Safe changes (additive-optional, help-text edits, choice-option additions) can commit directly. Unsafe changes need a pattern of **plan, dual-write, backfill, then cutover**, documented per change class.

## Risk classification

| Change | Risk | Requires |
|---|---|---|
| Add optional field (any type) | Safe | Direct commit + dry-run smoke test |
| Add required field | Medium | Add as optional first, backfill all entries, then flip to required |
| Add option to a `choice` field | Safe | Direct commit |
| Remove option from a `choice` field | Medium | Backfill entries using the removed value first |
| Rename a field | High | Dual-write (new name plus old alias), backfill, update every binding, cut over, then remove the alias |
| Retype a field (compatible: `single_line` to `multi_line`) | Medium | Backfill probably-fine values. Validate no truncation |
| Retype a field (incompatible: `text` to `number`) | High | Add new field + backfill via transform + update bindings + remove old field |
| Remove a field | High | Backfill any downstream dependency + update bindings + soft-delete first (rename to `<field>_deprecated`), then remove after N days |
| Extract a group to a Global Field | Medium | Create the GF, dual-write to both the CT group and the GF for one release, update bindings, then remove the CT group |
| Retarget a Reference field | High | Backfill references (bulk update entries) + update bindings. May involve `import-content` if the target CT itself needs seeding |

## Task

### Step 1: Read the intended change

The user says one of:

- "Add a field `read_time` (number, optional) to `blog_post`."
- "Rename `blog_post.title` to `blog_post.headline`."
- "Extract `blog_post.hero` and `product.hero` into a Global Field."

Parse: source CT + field(s) + intended mutation. Reject vague inputs: "clean up the schema" is not actionable. Ask for a specific change.

### Step 2: Fetch the current CT schema

Use CMA `/v3/content_types/<uid>` (stack management token from env). Store the current schema locally as `docs/_migration-state/<ct_uid>-before.json`. This is the rollback artefact. Never proceed without a snapshot.

### Step 3: Classify + emit the migration plan

Match the requested change against the risk table. Emit a plan:

```
MIGRATION PLAN · blog_post.title → blog_post.headline
Risk: 🔴 HIGH (field rename)

Current entries in blog_post: 342 (fetched via CMA /entries?count=true).

Plan:
  1. Add new field `headline` (single_line, optional) alongside `title` — safe, no downtime.
  2. Backfill: for every entry, copy `title` value → `headline`. Idempotent (skip entries where `headline` already populated).
  3. Update Section bindings: enumerate every Section currently binding `title`. Report before applying — user confirms.
  4. Cutover: switch bound Sections to bind `headline`. Republish affected compositions.
  5. Cool-off: leave `title` in place for N days (default 14) — rollback window.
  6. Remove `title` after cool-off + verify no remaining bindings.

Rollback: docs/_migration-state/blog_post-before.json restores pre-change schema. Compositions with bindings to `title` restored via git revert of the composition changes committed in Step 4.

Dry-run: no changes applied yet. Approve to proceed?
```

Wait for explicit approval. Never mutate the CT without user go-ahead.

### Step 4: Execute the plan step-by-step, with checkpoints

Update `docs/_migration-state/<ct_uid>-migration.json` after **every** completed step:

```json
{
  "ct_uid": "blog_post",
  "migration": "rename-title-to-headline",
  "steps": [
    { "id": "1-add-headline", "status": "completed", "at": "2026-..." },
    { "id": "2-backfill-headline", "status": "in-progress", "records_completed": 214, "records_total": 342 },
    { "id": "3-list-bindings", "status": "pending" },
    { "id": "4-cutover-bindings", "status": "pending" },
    { "id": "5-cooloff", "status": "pending", "cooloff_ends": "2026-..." },
    { "id": "6-remove-title", "status": "pending" }
  ]
}
```

Between destructive steps, **pause and require explicit user go-ahead**. Never remove a field automatically after the cool-off ends. Wait for the user to invoke the skill again with `--continue --step=6-remove-title` (or equivalent). This protects against accidental destruction if a rollback is silently in progress.

### Step 5: Rollback support

At any point, the user can invoke:

- "Roll back the `title → headline` migration."

Skill reads the state file + the `before.json` snapshot, walks back the completed steps in reverse:

- Step 6 completed: not applicable (already destroyed).
- Steps 1-5 completed: revert bindings, remove the new field, unbackfill (if user wants, usually leaves headline values populated but bindings point back to title).

**If Step 6 (remove old field) already ran, rollback is destructive. The data is gone.** Report clearly + ask for confirmation before continuing.

## Inputs needed from the user

1. The change (specific: field name, source CT, target state).
2. Target stack UID + management token (from env or explicit).
3. Explicit approval after the migration plan is emitted (dry-run before commit).
4. Confirmation between destructive steps (backfill, cutover, then remove).
5. Optional: cool-off period override (default 14 days).

## Acceptance

- [ ] Migration plan is emitted + explicitly approved before any CMA writes.
- [ ] `<ct>-before.json` snapshot captured before any mutation.
- [ ] `<ct>-migration.json` state file updated after every step.
- [ ] Between destructive steps (cutover, remove), user is prompted. The skill does not auto-continue.
- [ ] Every Section binding affected by the change is enumerated + updated. None left dangling.
- [ ] Rollback path documented in the plan + executable via a follow-up skill invocation.
- [ ] For medium/high-risk changes: cool-off period between backfill and destructive step.

## Common pitfalls

| Pitfall | Why it bites | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Direct field rename via CMA `/v3/content_types/<uid>` PUT | CMA does rename the schema, but existing entries retain the old field name in `_data`, so new bindings return null and the live site breaks | Never rename directly. Always dual-write via new field + backfill + cutover. |
| Skipping the `<ct>-before.json` snapshot | Rollback becomes hand-crafted. May miss field metadata (mandatory flags, unique constraints, display names) | Snapshot mandatory. Never proceed without one. |
| Backfilling without idempotency check | Re-run overwrites in-progress author edits | Skip records where the target field is already populated by an author. |
| Auto-continuing after cool-off | Old field removed silently, so downstream systems still expecting it break | Never auto-continue destructive steps. Manual re-invocation required. |
| Not updating Section bindings | Field renamed, Sections still bind the old name, so the live site shows nothing | Enumerate every affected binding + update in the same run. Use `discover-sections` or grep composition JSON. |
| Treating "add required field" as safe | Live entries have no value, so the CT update rejects | Add as optional, backfill all entries, then flip to required. Three-step, not one. |
